### Leaders ###
 POLITICS_JACK_REED_DESC:0 "As the United States crashed into flame and a Syndicalist revolution grew in the Steel Belt, at its forefront stood John \"Jack\" Reed - a writer, a trade unionist, a journalist and a Senator, if not more. Born to a business family on the West Coast, he lived an unassuming upper-class life until studies in Harvard, where he, coming into contact with socialist clubs and literature, came to realise that there is a world beyond the dull halls of college, and that world suffered constant hardship. Despite being in poor health from birth, Reed chose a traveller's life, working as a common labourer to make a living and travel from nation to nation, and gaining fame as a war correspondent.\n\nWhat earned him more fame, however, was his involvement in the great revolutions of the period. The first he witnessed was the Mexican one as early as 1913, then the Russian one, in 1917, which he worked for devoutly and which consolidated his revolutionary socialist beliefs. It was during this time period that he wrote the 10 Days That Shook the World, his most famous work. In 1918, he returned to America, but was no longer welcome by America and its anti-sedition acts, so a year later, he fled again - this time to France, to a new, brewing revolution, and unlike the Russian one, actually successful. Fighting alongside the French Syndicalists dictated Reed a goal in life - to import this success to America, to have it be the next to come, and with America's unfathomable industrial might, bring forth a world revolution.\n\nA long time has passed since then, and Reed has achieved far - he has helped orchestrate the union of American socialists into one united front, served as a Senator, as a Presidential candidate, and has finally called the Steel Belt to revolution. However, his goal remains the same - to be the next great revolutionary, to be the same figure greater than life which the lowly war correspondent from twenty years ago would write about."
 POLITICS_JOHN_NANCE_GARNER_DESC:0 "John Nance Garner IV, known by his peers as 'Cactus Jack', is a lawyer and long-serving Representative from Texas and the new President of the United States. He is a man of the Democratic establishment, a mildly conservative politician, and, most importantly, a fervent supporter of democracy. This Texan judge is wary of compromise with the radicals, though he may have to compromise with the radical right for the good of the country."
 POLITICS_HERBERT_HOOVER_DESC:0 "A former U.S. Secretary of Commerce and now the current President of the United States, Herbert Hoover has solidified his position as one of the most hated men in American history. Despite only making the Great Depression worse during his first term, Hoover was re-elected through the House of Representatives in 1932, causing widespread outrage. It's a sad reality for the president - any and all of his attempts for restoring the economy fail, his attempts to calm the situation down only make it worse, and even his own party is turning away from him."
 POLITICS_DOUGLAS_MACARTHUR_DESC:0 "Born a military brat and spending his childhood moving from one army camp to another, Douglas MacArthur asserts that he learned to ride and shoot before he could read or write - and those skills were what he tied the rest of his career to. The most successful son of Lt. General Arthur MacArthur, he followed the steps of his father and enrolled in the United States Military Academy at West Point, then - immediately to fighting against insurgencies in the Philippines and the occupation of Veracruz during the Mexican Revolution. By the 1920s, he was already the youngest Major General in the United States Army and the super-intendant of West Point, which he reformed to address the changes in modern warfare since the Weltkrieg. After service in his old academy, he returned to his second home, the Philippines - but his time there was brief, as deteriorating situation in the United States forced him to return in 1930.\n\nAs political battles raged in Congress and behind closed doors, MacArthur's name kept being mentioned as a blessing or as a curse - everyone knew of his persona, and everyone knew what it stood for. To imagine that the United States Army could intervene in civilian politics, undermine democracy, as if it was some tinpot Latin American dictatorship and not the birthplace of democracy... was a hard pill to swallow for many in the upper echelons of government. President Hoover found himself relying upon MacArthur's strongarm control of the army more and more to prevent a collapse of order, and now that he's gone, the General made no surprises and did exactly what was foretold.\n\nWrapping himself in the corpse of American democracy, MacArthur now commands a junta of conservative politicians and business interests to defend the America they hold dear from everyone on the political spectrum. To what end? To be a Cincinnatus, or a Caesar? Only the flamboyant, egotistical, yet surprisingly enigmatic General in Washington knows."
 POLITICS_DOUGLAS_MACARTHUR_CIVILIAN_DESC:0 "When America was in crisis, the name "Douglas MacArthur" was often spoken of in the halls of Congress with worried tones, men fearful of the prospect that he may simply march on the White House and prove to be the slayer of American democracy. But though the later war would scar the United States forever, democracy, however damaged, survived. MacArthur's career, on the other hand, prospered. His talented command, strong leadership, and affinity for the national spotlight transformed him into a war hero. With the conflict's end, it came as little surprise that he would seek the nation's highest office through more legal means.\n\nWinning the Republican nomination and finally the elections, America's citizens hope that their new President can show the same resolve he did in war, at peace."
 POLITICS_HUEY_LONG_DESC:0 "Like many people of his stature and personality, Governor Huey Pierce Long is known by many names, although the most common one is \"the Kingfish\". Born to a poor rural family in Louisiana, he clawed and bit his way to a legal career over the course of his life, all while gaining notoriety as one of the most talented legal minds of recent history, and as a dedicated defender of the interests of the poor. Within a shockingly brief time, he was already one of the most famous politicians in Louisiana, and so became one of the youngest governors in its history as a result.\n\nLouisiana would become the model province for a set of programs and policies which would collectively be labelled 'Share Our Wealth'. Long built a vast public services apparatus and an unprecedented system of social spending upon a patronage system which swiftly transformed Louisiana into a dictatorship, with the Long family at the helm. In America's increasingly volatile conditions, however, such forceful measures to help the poor became increasingly popular and thus formed the policy backbone of the America First Party, to whom Louisiana was an ideal to reach towards. Thanks to Long's increasingly wide and fragile reach of contacts and alliances across the whole country, it grew far out of Louisiana, and today, as the United States stand divided, they have all been put to action as a major force in the Second American Civil War.\n\nThe legal scene and the political soapbox are Long's natural waters, not army planning committees and military parades, and unlike the Syndicalists, this was not what he planned from the start - but now that all bets are off, may all enemies of the Kingfish tremble."
 POLITICS_FLOYD_OLSON_DESC:0 "Despite his rural upbringing, Floyd Olson has been able to see the great diversity in America through travel and activism. Working as a Shabbos goy, an IWW stevedore, and finally an attorney pushed Olson towards Progressivism in the 1920s. Olson joined up with Robert LaFollete’s Farmer-Labor Party following the 1924 election. Olson worked tirelessly for the next decade in order to gain allies for the Farmer-Labor Party, stopping only to seek treatment for his stomach ulcers in 1930. A reputation as a surprisingly influential Governor of Minnesota and a national advocate for peace catapulted him into the White House on a bipartisan ticket against radicalism."
 POLITICS_QUENTIN_ROOSEVELT_DESC:0 "The youngest son of former president Theodore Roosevelt, from an early age Quentin was groomed for political activism in his father's Republican Party. Quentin, however, wished to be a pilot, but was injured in his training in 1918. Seeing his family being torn by Archibald Roosevelt's entry into Huey Long's camp, Quentin entered politics and served as New York's Senator during the fateful year of 1936. Now that the great national disaster is over, Quentin plans to follow in his father's footsteps and push for a new American Fair Deal."
 POLITICS_ALF_LANDON_DESC:0 "Alf Landon was a successful entrepreneur in the oil business long before his entry into politics. This self-starter created the United States Oil and Gas Association, a lobbying group associated with Standard Oil that Landon remains attached to this day. What initially seemed like a poor decision to break with Hoover's non-interventionist position at the 11th hour before election day turned to his advantage when the Republican Party came with him. Even Hoover has begrudgingly come to endorse Landon, despite this personal betrayal of confidence. Now, despite his humble demeanour, Landon has proven to be the soft voice of confident economic recovery that America wanted. His strong ties with the oil lobby, however, make him an enemy of both socialists and Longists."
 POLITICS_WENDELL_WILLKIE_DESC:0 "Wendell Willkie has been many things in his life before the presidency. He began as a William Jennings Dixiecrat, became a socialist in college, and rumours persist that he seduced Soong Mei Ling during a diplomatic visit to China in 1933 - not to mention an affair with writer Irita Van Doren. He continued to stand out when he opposed Democrats to push for a bank holiday when the Great Depression hit. This support for financial institutions and his assertions that government aid should not interfere with market competition made him a possible pick for Democrat John Garner's running mate in 1936, and he served well during the 1936 campaign and afterwards. That time in the limelight propelled him to national prominence, enough to take power within the decade. It remains to be seen whether this polytalented man can handle the many roles of the presidency."
 POLITICS_HARRY_BYRD_DESC:0 "Whereas many southern populists fell to Huey Long's charms and deserted the Democratic Party, Harry F. Byrd stood his ground. Harry Byrd was born into a Virginian Brahmin family with a direct line to the American Revolution, and is a firm believer in segregation and fiscally conservative policies intended to reduce the national debt. Holding firm to his anti-Keynesian policies, Harry Byrd won as the stabilising image of American traditional establishment."
 POLITICS_PHILIP_LA_FOLLETTE_DESC:0 "A professional Wisconsin progressive, Philip is the most successful of the politically active La Follette family. A friend and former mentor to Floyd Olson, who had been convinced to join the Farmer-Labor Party in order to continue to help his state in need. With the spectre of isolationism that Philip's father Robert stood for, Philip nonetheless stands behind the need for a strong military in the Americas as well as the full extent and strength of the government as promoted by the Farmer-Labor Party."
 POLITICS_HENRY_WALLLACE_DESC:0 "Humble beginnings as an Iowa farmer did not dissuade a young Henry Wallace from seeing the world and gaining worldly insight. His fortune came from inventing hybrid corn breeds, a major innovation that allowed Wallace to travel the world. Henry visited India and became acquainted with Theosophy, a Hinduist school of thought popular in Russia that draws elements from Christian Anarchism and Socialism. These teachings ultimately alienated him from mainstream socialism and pushed him into the Farmer-Labor Party when he returned. Wallace portrays himself above all else a pragmatic economist and an agricultural expert capable of the agrarian reform America needs."
 POLITICS_JAMES_MURRAY_DESC:0 "A great controversy surrounded the election of James E. Murray during his election campaign. Tabloids and Republicans all came at Murray claiming that he cannot run for President due to being born in Canada. The truth of these statements may never be known, but his life prior to attending NYU is shrouded in mystery. His life began in earnest when Murray won the Governorship of Montana in 1933. His term as a Democrat was marked by an unusually cooperate relationship with unions and his bold belief that economic reform must disrupt a market if the market is failing."
 POLITICS_ALBEN_BARKLEY_DESC:0 "Alben draws from over thirty years of political experience within the Democrat party and his own smart judgement. While Alben supported Wilson's reforms, he opposed McAdoo's attempts to reverse those policies. After several failed national election bids and a steady voting record, Alben was the right piece on the chess board in this election to gain the White House for the Democrats."
 POLITICS_RICHARD_RUSSELL_DESC:0 "The final ascent into the White House by Richard Russell Jr. is the final stroke in a long game that extends even before his time in the Democrat party. Russell Jr. has accumulated the right combination of titles in the US Navy, in the Georgian House of Representatives, and the US Congress to secure universal respect. His focus that de-segregation should happen entirely on southern terms proved popular with a national audience. Time will tell whether this position is sustainable."
 POLITICS_GLEN_TAYLOR_DESC:0 "Being President was just as much a surprise to Glen Taylor as it was to the voting public. The man that had wanted at one point to be a wandering preacher and then a country singer had finally reached a position that befitted his skills. Taylor was known in Congress as a compassionate economist and advocate of progressive policies and singing to children on the steps of the Capitol. Taylor's compassion fuelled his opposition to segregation, and despite his eccentricities he has endeared himself to the American people, which is all he ever wanted."
 POLITICS_THOMAS_DEWEY_DESC:0 "Dewey - the natural born leader and politician that made it in New York despite his Michigan upbringing. Dewey has continuously proven his assertions correct, including predicting a war in Europe, Asia, and the Americas in the 1930s. His assertions that the New Deal wouldn't be owed entirely to the Republicans was also proven correct. Dewey campaigned under 'Compassionate Capitalism' and tried to distance the reforms from being necessarily welfare. Finally, Dewey's bold prediction that he would win the election came true."
 POLITICS_EARL_WARREN_DESC:0 "Young Earl Warren thought his career was doomed when his father Mathias was blacklisted for joining a strike, but instead it motivated the young man into excelling past this stigma. This prior stigma motivated Earl into joining numerous fraternities and lodges in order to intermingle with the people that stigmatised his father, as well as serving in the military. These connections paid off and sent Earl into a life of public service and eventually reached the Governor seat of California in 1930, where he steered the declining Progressive movement towards the political centre away from the even more declining West Coast Socialist Party. Earl became a progressive entryist within the Republican party, pushing for national desegregation."
 POLITICS_CHARLES_MCNARY_DESC:0 "Charles McNary stood behind the foundation of the Republican party when it was under attack from all angles in 1936, serving as Alf Landon's running mate. A Progressive at heart but also a pragmatist, McNary was seen within the party as an insurance against the Northwest descending into radicalism, which also made him allies with an ally of Entente interests in North America. In fact, his company provided electricity to a significant portion of Western Canada by the 1940s due to this relationship."
 POLITICS_HARRY_TRUMAN_DESC:0 "Harry Truman's farming career seemed settled before the Great Depression and Dust Bowl set him bankrupt after another failed attempt to get rich. Truman entered politics in the late 1920s as a voice for farmers’ welfare and an agent of the Pendergast machine in Kansas City. In 1938, Truman rose to the ranks of the United States Senate, and in the years afterward surprised his colleagues with his true abilities in tracking and eliminating the waste in Reconstruction. He has also sponsored many bills to help the everyman in the cities and countryside, rising to become the liberal Democrats’ most highly rated candidates among the electorate. After a narrow victory in the 1948 elections, he now looks over an America ready to begin helping itself and the world in a way it never could before."
 POLITICS_WILLIAM_HARRIMAN_DESC:0 "Coming from a prominent business family with ties to international trade, William Harriman was able to establish several successful businesses in New York and became an important player in interstate trade. As the federal government has jurisdiction over those transactions, Harriman joined the Department of Commerce. A tactical minded approach to foreign policy and the goal of promoting America's ideology against the radicals that threatened her abroad resonated with Americans and pushed his career upwards."
 POLITICS_STROM_THURMOND_DESC:0 "The decision by Strom to turn the Conservative Manifesto into a raison d’état for the Conservative wing of the Democratic Party was a risky move. Strom had spent decades within the Democratic Party attempting to oppose the overreaching powers of the Federal Government, and ensuring that the party never officially endorse desegregation. This gamble has now paid off as Strom Thurmond has been elected President."
 POLITICS_HAPPY_CHANDLER_DESC:0 "The turning point in Happy Chandler's career came during his intermission in politics to become the Commissioner of Baseball. A term as Governor had established Chandler as a respectable and industrious Democrat with a firm hand on the party line. This stint as Commissioner of Baseball saw a historical decision to allow integrated baseball teams, which led to the end of segregated baseball. This only further elevated Chandler as a Senator and made his decision to carry this support into the Conservative wing of the Democratic Party even more important. His insistence that fiscal conservatism and the race question were not tied together stood against Strom Thurmond's line..."
 POLITICS_JOHN_BRICKER_DESC:0 "An advocate for limited executive power and a non-interventionist interpretation, John Bricker is as old fashioned a Republican as they come. Bricker's career prior to his presidency was that of a rabble raiser and dissenter within the Republican Party railing against suspected socialist sympathisers and opposing the use of executive power to push economic reform. The country as a whole having come close to populist or authoritarian dictatorships just a few years prior."
 POLITICS_HAROLD_STASSEN_DESC:0 "While the senior Republican Party leadership like McNary and Dewey had preoccupied the 1930s with the minutia of the 1936 crisis, Harold Stassen was serving in the US Navy and being exposed into the wider world. An important lesson learned is the importance of international cooperation as opposed to the tariffs that his fellow Republicans were pushing for. A firm opponent of international syndicalism, Stassen believes that laissez faire economic policies must be replaced by strategic economic cooperation There is no need to hold onto undemocratic institutions such as segregation which only feeds syndicalist arguments."
 POLITICS_DWIGHT_EISENHOWER_DESC:0 "A student of warfare in the famous Class of 1915, Eisenhower's initial enthusiasm for testing new military doctrines vanished in Central America, as generals there failed to win against poorly trained insurgencies. While others in this class fell to either the urge for dictatorship or radicalism. Eisenhower stood firm with the Federal government and tried to stay out of civilian politics. He has been quoted as saying that he wouldn’t want to be any politician, from 'dogcatcher to Grand High Supreme King of the Universe.' Four years after he made that statement, though, Eisenhower was being sworn in as President. This came from a national acceptance for the desegregation of the military Eisenhower oversaw."
 POLITICS_ADLAI_STEVENSON_DESC:0 "The reputation of Adlai Stevenson's father, that of an isolationist, dogged Adlai Stevenson II well into his political career. This position among the Democrats was put to the test with the America First Party, which depleted the party ranks. Adlai stood to his roots during this most contentious time and persevered. As Governor of Illinois Adlai reformed the police force to be less at odds with socialists and even defended their rights to organise in the face of the Red Scare. Most doubted Adlai's ability to win against the respected General Eisenhower, but through an in kind appreciation from socialist voters Adlai won in the end."
 POLITICS_JOHN_SPARKMAN_DESC:0 "Born in a log cabin and raised on a farm, John Sparkman had a very relatable upbringing. A rapidly ascending legal career and political clubs later and Sparkman had become the Democratic Representative for Huntsville. His victory being especially important in the fateful Year of '36 as he beat the AFP's candidate. Sparkman was instrumental in opening education up to immigrants and women in the South. Silent on social matters and bolstered by his support of science education, Sparkman spoke out against defensive US foreign policy, and eventually left for the Constitution Party, where his reputation put him on the fast track to presidency."
 POLITICS_JAMES_EASTLAND_DESC:0 "Son of the Mississippi Delta District Attorney, James Eastland was sidetracked from politics for the first three decades in order to run a plantation. An advocate of sharecropping who profited from their work until his plantation quadrupled in size. Eastland stood up in the Senatorial race against the Klan's candidate, and won. Against the Conservative Coalition, Eastman supported the Fair Deal legislation in his home state while voting for it in Congress. As his reputation and passage into the Constitution Party carried much weight, he successfully lead many Democratic voters to his campaign as the closest thing the party could offer to a national candidate."
 POLITICS_CULBERT_OLSON_DESC:0 "Culbert Olson had faced both the stigma of running as a Mormon politician, and running as an atheist in his lifetime. In California as Governor, Culbert had to deal with long standing rumours that Mormons had a blood feud with the US Government. Olson's superb term as Governor in passing health care legislation and allowing non-SPA socialists to organise. By the time of the national race, Culbert had come out as an atheist, and faced a second uphill battle. The party stood by him, and ultimately his portfolio allowed him to reach the White House."
 POLITICS_EMMETT_ANDERSON_DESC:0 "Hailing from Tacoma, Washington, Emmett T. Anderson was a successful printmaker before politics. During the Crisis of '37, Emmett ensured that presses for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer got out during the strike in Seattle. Emmett also ran his own pamphlets during the crisis decrying the Seattle Democrats as allies of the Silver Legion, and pressed to a peaceful end to the strike. After this the Republican Party got wind, and Emmett was elected to Congress. Eventually his actions were taken up on a national level by Republicans, and became a rallying cry against Democrats that made the difference during the election."
 POLITICS_JOHN_GELLATLY_DESC:0 "From bankruptcy in Benton County, Oregon, John Arthur Gellatly distinguished himself as a responsible fiscal conservative. After being elected to Washington State Senate in 1918, Gellatly made several runs for Governor throughout the 1920s and '30s, finally succeeding as Lieutenant Governor during the Crisis of '37. The second election of the Pacific states required a reliable and uncontroversial Republican candidate for stability, and Gellatly was their man."
 POLITICS_HOWARD_HUGES_DESC:0 "Son of an All-American family of ministers and inventors, Howard Hughes broke out of the Midwest by demonstrating a knack for engineering. After the tragic death of his parents, young Howard was thrust into a family fortune and a medical facility in Maryland. Using this vast fortune, Howard created the Summa Tool Corporation, a maker of fine industrial tools. The proceeds were funnelled into Howard's Hollywood scripts, including the Academy Award winner 'The World Is Yours'. Expanding finally into Republican politics in California, Howard stood out among a crowd of old money. From RKO to a line of passenger aircraft, Howard was elected under the promise to finish Boulder Dam in Colorado and electrify the states."
 POLITICS_FRANK_MERRIAM_DESC:0 "Son of Civil War veterans, Frank Merriam was born in Iowa and planned for a legal career in the Midwest. Upon seeing the rising prominence of the California Republican Party, Frank shifted his career out west. It was Merriam more than anyone that defeated the SPA in California, defeating the Longshoremen strike, and even rebuffing Upton Sinclair when he became the Democrat nominee for Governor. Despite this, traditionally Republican papers resisted Merriam's tax reforms. Upon the ascension of MacArthur, most of these papers were ordered by Hearst to decry all Republicans. Merriam was able to use the public outcry against Hearst and MacArthur to gain the executive seat."
 POLITICS_FLETCHER_BOWRON_DESC:0 "A California native and veteran of the Nicaragua War, Fletcher Bowron has a unique relationship with Latin Americans among Republican politicians. The first mayor of Los Angeles to support Cinco De Mayo parades, and an advocate of imprisoning radicals on suspicion. This coupled with Bowron's pursuit of organised crime impressed hardline republicans enough to put him in a greater office."
 POLITICS_ROBERT_TAYLOR_DESC:0 "Robert Taylor Jones began as a civil engineer out of Tennessee. The most significant project Jones was on was the Panama Canal. The boom of civil constructions out west drew Jones into Arizona, where he entered Democratic politics on a constructive platform. Serving as Governor of Arizona during the Crisis of '37, Jones countered the SPA and AFP candidates who sought to push the state into rebellion. Sadly, rebellion was forced upon the state when MacArthur came, and several democratic politicians betrayed the republic for autocracy. Thankfully Jones had contact with the true loyal Democratic Party, and campaigned for national office."
 POLITICS_CLARENCE_MARTIN_DESC:0 "Clarence Martin came into prominence during a consequential Washington State election of 1932, which unseated many Republicans from state office. Clarence may have come in during a major shift, but his credentials in Washington included fostering small business and his unusually respectful discourse. Clarence on principle refused to exaggerate or appeal to populist tendencies in his election campaign, and distinguished himself in the Washington Senate by sponsoring necessary civil works projects. As the Democratic Party was able to wrest the civil works initiative from Republicans across the West, Clarence reaped the benefits politically and received more votes in '36 than Garner in Washington. The desertion of some Democrats to MacArthur only made Clarence's loyalty stand out, and his nomination to the executive chair that more likely."
 POLITICS_OSWALD_WEST_DESC:0 "West was luck that the provisional government set up after MacArthur's rise did not specify natural born Americans, as he was born in Canada. Starting out as a Land Agent for Oregon, Oswald West was always diligent with his work. As Governor, West saw passage of Women's Suffrage, Worker Rights, and even state Prohibition, all strengthening the Democratic Party in the state. Taking the initiative to finance a State highway System without Federal money, West successfully pushed public projects. A more fervent advocate of conservative democratic laws on alcohol and even authorising sterilisation as punishment for breaking morality codes."
 POLITICS_CHARLES_SPRAGUE_DESC:0 "A newspaper magnate and business owner, Sprague got his start in Oregon politics as a newspaper commentator. Reprinted nationally and famed for his advocacy of small business, internationalisation, and fiscal conservatism, many expected him to enter into Democratic politics. Sprague instead ran as a Republican, and successfully capture democrat voters who supported a fiscally conservative but active Fair Deal. A surprising number of SPA also voted him into Governorship, as he supported their employment programs. This position he encouraged within the Republican Party, and eventually allowed him to gain support throughout the West."
 POLITICS_RALPH_CARR_DESC:0 "A follower of Hoover's Republican Party, Ralph Carr's politics in Colorado were fiscally conservative and socially mixed. While Carr did deploy the National Guard to end the Green Mountain Dam Strike of '36, within the PSA Carr refused to imprison radicals. Going so far as to pardon several AFL labour leaders that were arrested without charges. Ultimately a Constitutionalist in a time of crisis where others were stretching legal boundaries. Carr was able to use this as leverage within the Republican Party to secure nomination and ultimately the election."
 POLITICS_JOSEPH_LEE_DESC:0 "Joseph Lee was one of the first hard right Utahan Republicans, being elected only shorty after Mormons were allowed into Congress. While others resisted the draft on religious grounds, Lee joined the military and eventually fell on hard times after veterans’ pensions dried up. Running for Governor as a Republican and promising to promote Veteran Pay, Lee had also become acquainted with the old boys’ network of politics. This old boy’s network almost led to his dismissal after he was caught in an illegal gambling den by pro-AFP sheriff W. Skousen. Lee continued to advocate for fiscal conservatism and for admission of all religious right groups into Republican circles, which eventually got him nominated for the highest office."
 POLITICS_MONRAD_WALLGREN_DESC:0 "Wallgren's career prior to politics was a combination of business management and pool sharking. A personable and approachable attitude helped jump-start his political career in Washington, especially during the close election of '36. The State Senate saw Wallgren's take an active role in national security, and advocate restricting press of radical elements, Wallgren stood firm as formerly Democratic papers were blacklisted along with SPA and AFP ones after they began supporting MacArthur. Wallgren's opposition eventually forced him out of the Democratic Party while in office, to which he responded by joining the up-and-coming Progressives."
 POLITICS_CLYDE_TINGLEY_DESC:0 "Clyde Tingley came to New Mexico to heal his wife's TB, which was worsening in the Ohio weather. Tingly became incensed at the Republican rule in New Mexico, and so began a career in politics and advocacy for health-care reform. A supporter of early Fair Deal proposals, Tingley flew into office on the promise that a new governorship would allow for better usage of state funds. Albuquerque began recovering from the Great Depression under Tingley even as most of the nation fell further, and his dedication to health care legislation pushed him into national politics where he became a Progressive."
 POLITICS_ARTHUR_LANGLIE_DESC:0 "After a decade on the Seattle City Council. and another four years in the State Senate, Arthur Langlie was one of the youngest nationally recognised politicians in Washington history. Running against and losing to Monrad Wallgren, Langlie recouped and ultimately ingratiated himself into the Republican Party enough to win the nomination. Seen by many as a common man and exemplifier of the immigrant spirit, Langlie answers the Progressive claims to represent immigrant rights."
 POLITICS_DOUGLAS_MCKAY_DESC:0 "Beginning work before he was out of High School, McKay thought his apex would be a used car dealership in Salem, Oregon. Instead, the Republican party encouraged him to run for local and then state offices, eventually being elected to the State Senate in '36. This climactic year saw McKay willingly leave his old supporters behind for the Progressives. An advocate for the national highway system, fiscally moderate Fair Deal policies, and a support for public works has moderated some of the Progressives more radical elements, and helped them take liberal Republican voting districts."
 POLITICS_DANIEL_THORNTON_DESC:0 "Active in the 4-H and agrarian rights program, Daniel Thornton moved to Colorado from Texas in order to run a cattle ranch. A brief career in the State Senate combined with his strong personality made his campaign as a Republican to Governorship fairly easy. Known for his Stetson hat, cowboy boots, and smoking pipe, many reports have called Thornton the 'Republican Garner'. The media seemed to place him at odds with Richard Nixon during the election, but their mutual understanding to allow the elder politician to run made the difference at the end."
 POLITICS_BOURKE_HICKENLOOPER_DESC:0 "Coming to the West after MacArthur's coup, Bourke initially had very little public support within the provisional government. Partnered with J. William Fullbright, Bourke helped whip the Republicans into shape, and pushed for an isolationist policy towards Canada and Japan. Seen by many as a patriot of a country on the brink of dissolution, Bourke won office by assuring a hard stand against all traitors to the American Republic."
 POLITICS_VICTOR_MEYERS_DESC:0 "A multi-talented if not disparate man, Victor Meyers has been called the 'Pagliacci of Politics' in his early days. Back when his political career competed with his musical career. Insisting that the Democrats oppose Prohibition in Washington, he rode aboard a beer wagon during his Gubernatorial campaign. After this, he began mixing Progressive policies with his natural talent to draw attention to himself. Promising tribes across the West voting rights, advocating pensions, child welfare and unemployment pay, Meyers was at times taken seriously and other times laughed at. A unique proposal for building single-pour concrete housing to solve the homeless issue proved to be both eccentric and effective. Ultimately the Progressives and the American people took him seriously enough to elect him into office."
 POLITICS_ANDREW_HOCKENHULL_DESC:0 "A quiet and unassuming politician, Hockenhull rose through the ranks of New Mexican politics through his strong adherence to the Democratic Party line. So, his switch to the Progressive Party in 1928 was a pragmatic switch. Although he did not win the Governorship in 1936, Hockenhull persisted in the public service until the Progressives were forced to run him."
 POLITICS_RICHARD_NIXON_DESC:0 "A native Californian and an obstinate quaker, Nixon attempted to join the FBI after college. After failing to do so, Nixon became a lawyer for the major oil companies of California. Nixon began a feud with fellow Republican Earl Warren, which persisted into the national political scene. Nixon took jobs prosecuting politicians in the Pacific States who were suspected of radicalism, and had a good winning record against socialists. Finally Nixon defeated Warren within the Republicans by promising him the Governorship of California in exchange for the National Nomination."
 POLITICS_GEORGE_CRAIG_DESC:0 "Born in Brazil, Indiana, and trained to be a lawyer, George Craig was classmates with his eventual electoral rival, William Jenner. Craig would eventually compete with Jenner for the Republican Party nomination after his service during the Crisis of '37. Craig's service constituted defending the American Legion of Clay County against the SPA, which informed his later anti-socialism. As Governor of Indiana, Craig reformed the state government, and refused funds for the national highway in favour of local contractors."
 POLITICS_VAL_PETERSON_DESC:0 "A school administrator in Nebraska for the first twenty years of his career, Peterson's introduction into politics came when he entered the US Air Force, and was assigned to trained with Hugh Butler. Butler eventually recommended him to Nebraska Governor Dwight Griswold. Peterson succeeded Griswold as Governor, and worked his way up the Republican Party power structure. Eisenhower recognised a fellow soldier and elevated Peterson within the Party, where he became a nationally recognised politician and presidential candidate."
 POLITICS_JOHN_WINANT_DESC:0 "A life filled with difficulty prior to his ascent into office, John Winant's fortunes turned often. From dropping out of Princeton due to inability to pay, to the US Air Service. His military rank had distinguished himself enough to be elected Governor of New Hampshire, while also losing his remaining fortune in the Great Depression. Made Ambassador to Canada, Winant became torn between his duty and an affair with MP Churchill's daughter Sarah. This relationship was broken off, and ultimately his contacts in Canada made his election to the Liberals surer. The chaos of '36 continues to press upon Winant's mind however."
 POLITICS_HERBERT_LEHMAN_DESC:0 "As of his inauguration, Herbert Lehman is the first Jewish Head of State in American History. Born into the storied Lehman family, and served in the US Army general staff, Lehman got his start supporting Al Smith's presidential campaign. Lehman served the rest of FDR's term after his death in 1921, and subsequent terms as Governor. Lehman opposed the conservative wing of the Democrats and opposed Eastland while addressing Congress. The Crisis of '37 forced Lehman out of NYC and into the provisional capital of Boston, where his shrewd dealings allowed him to secure safe passage of refugees into New England from the CSA."
 POLITICS_PERCIVAL_BAXTER_DESC:0 "A sentry for Maine Republicanism, Percival Baxter has stood against radicalism in his state for decades. Baxter's term as Senator saw a massive expansion to national parks in Maine, and successfully kept the lands free during the Depression. In 1936, Baxter banished several Republicans from the party after uncovering their Klan membership. The rise of MacArthur saw Baxter pushed into New Englander politics, where he represented a return to normal non-radical republican politics."
 POLITICS_JOSEPH_KENNEDY_DESC:0 "Born into an Irish Catholic family in Boston, which placed the Kennedy's just out of reach of the political elite. Joseph Kennedy was guided into Harvard to achieve as high a prominence as possible from his birth. Family troubles like the lobotomy of his eldest daughter was pushed aside in favour of dynasty building and business growth. Kennedy owned the largest whiskey importation company in America, and reinvested profits into businesses that sadly fell in the Great Depression. The Crisis of '37 and the reorganisation of New England allowed Kennedy to rally the Democratic voters to his side, becoming the first Catholic Head of State in American history."
 POLITICS_CHRISTIAN_HERTER_DESC:0 "Born in Paris, and moving to Boston at a young age, Herter came into wealth via marriage to the Pratt family. Sent to the German Embassy, Herter would frequently recommend America intervene in the Weltkrieg to no avail. His return saw him becoming Governor of Massachusetts, and the establishment of essential diplomatic ties with Canada that came into play in '37. Herter continues to advocate America's entry into the Entente, the liberation of democratic France, and the final justice of dismantling the German Empire."
 POLITICS_JOSEPH_MARTIN_DESC:0 "Among the Republican establishment in the Northeast, Joe Martin Jr. had the most sway. Beginning as a newspaper editor of the Boston Evening Chronicle, Martin was elected to the State Senate. Martin fought gerrymandering by the Democrats and eventually joined the Republican National Committee in 1936. Just in time for the nation to collapse. Martin rallied conservative Republicans who opposed Reed and Long's expansion of federal powers and ultimately opposed MacArthur's usurper Democrats. This allowed him to gain the upper hand on New England Democrats and win the snap election."
 POLITICS_DENNIS_ROBERTS_DESC:0 "A quiet but integral member to the Democratic establishment, his cooperation with the Canadian Liberal party saw his rise through a Canadian sponsored election campaign. This campaign emphasised his loyalty to Rhode Island, his Naval service, and his voting record in favour of civil rights."
 POLITICS_PETER_GERRY_DESC:0 "A protégé' of MP Lyon Mackenzie King, great grandson of VP Elbridge Gerry, and inheritor to a vast fortune, Gerry already had a leg up in politics. Becoming the Democratic Whip in the 1920s while a Senator for Rhode Island, Gerry worked his way up the political and social ladder. Marrying into and gaining the support of the Vanderbilt family helped Garry finance bailouts for Rhode Island businesses. MP King convinced Gerry to join the Liberals in 1940 in order to advance their common interest in social liberalism, which eventually paid off in his presidential campaign."
 POLITICS_SHERMAN_ADAMS_DESC:0 "A career that spans Vermont, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and ultimately the executive chair. Serving as the Republican Speaker of the House in 1940, Sherman pushed through Old Age Pensions laws and worked towards a balanced budget Fair Deal road-map. This ultimately proved popular with Americans after decades of indecisive economic policy, and was used heavily in Sherman's presidential campaign."
 POLITICS_ROBERT_BRADFORD_DESC:0 "A Republican in a strongly Democratic Massachusetts, Bradford's combination of fiscal conservatism and social liberalism helped make the case for his term as Governor in 1938. There Bradford successfully prevented strikes from going violent and used public funds to build homes to solve the housing issue. Bradford chaired a Silent Guest program during the turmoil of '36, asking Americans to donate the cost of a meal to the public relief for refugees from Macarthur. This charitable attitude continues into his term in the executive office."
 POLITICS_MAURICE_TOBIN_DESC:0 "Tobin's career nearly ended when he was indicted for malpractice that caused the Coconut Grove fire of 1938. Tobin was charged with refusing to allow a club to be closed in order for safety measures to be installed. Tobin learned from this tragic mistake and became a rare Democratic supporter of unions. The union vote helped elevate Tobin within the Democratic Party, where he protected organisation rights, and worked this into a reconciliation position during his national campaign."
 POLITICS_PAUL_DEVER_DESC:0 "As a lawyer, Dever made a career in Boston defending business practices of corporations. This all changed when Dever enlisted in the US Army, and served alongside mixed race divisions. As he found out that most of these soldiers were in the Liberal party, Dever entered into politics under the Liberals. An uphill battle against Democrats in Massachusetts commenced that saw Dever promise veteran benefits and welfare extension."
 POLITICS_GEORGE_AIKEN_DESC:0 "Aiken, the stalwart Republican and advocate of state-controlled Fair Deal legislation. Aiken in the State Congress passed laws to protect debtors during the Great Depression from losing their all-in debt collection. As Governor, Aiken instituted a pay-as-you go system for road maintenance that worked better than Fair Deal highways in New Hampshire. As a result, Aiken was chosen to run for the party nomination against conservative Republicans."
 POLITICS_THOMAS_HART_DESC:0 "An admiral during the inter-war period, Hart had built a reputation of personal bravery and the ability to manoeuvre among politicians stateside. Manoeuvring helped by his marriage of his daughter into the Wilson political family. Ultimately Hart decided to run in national elections as a Democrat, appealing to the impoverished voting base of his native Connecticut."
 POLITICS_CHARLES_POLETTI_DESC:0 "Unlike some of his more privileged Republican counterparts at Harvard, Democrat Charles Poletti was not born into one of the leading WASP families of the Northeast. The son of Italian immigrants, Poletti attended college on a scholarship, waiting tables to pay for textbooks. Quickly moving up the ranks of the Democratic party, Polletti's rustic charm enamoured him with working-class voters across the country. Now President, Poletti has an ambitious reform agenda of racial integration, expanding welfare, and an aggressive anti-syndicalist international stance. Whether his domestic reforms will earn the support of his more conservative counterparts remains to be seen, however."
 POLITICS_NELSON_ROCKEFELLER_DESC:0 "While some pundits are saying the name 'Rockefeller' alone catapulted Nelson to the presidency, Rockefeller's ascendancy to the highest office in the land was no given. Ivy League-educated, and initially working mainly in the business world, the radicalism among other Republican candidates encouraged Nelson to run for the presidency as a check on his more extreme counterparts. Using his family network to seize control of the nomination, Rockefeller's progressive approaches to health-care, welfare, and the economy may be the key to helping unite a divided country."
 POLITICS_HENRY_LODGE_JR_DESC:0 "Born into a prominent political dynasty with roots in both New Jersey and Massachusetts, it was no surprise that Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. decided to enter national politics. With a strong family network to rely on, he quickly built a strong power base among the powerful WASP families of the Northeast, catapulting him to the Republican nomination, and now the presidency. More moderate and diplomatic than other Republican candidates, it remains to be seen which direction he will take America in internationally..."
 POLITICS_OWEN_BREWSTER_DESC:0 "Hailing from the quiet forests of Maine, Owen Brewster has emerged as a national leader in the anti-syndicalist movement. While initially supporting Huey Long and the AFP in the early 1930s, Long's rejection of the Klan, close allies of Brewster, led to him rejoin the Republican party. Brewster is infamous in Maine, and across the country, for his open courting of the Klan, who were influential in his early gubernatorial and Senate victories. Now President of a divided America, it remains to be seen whether he can reconcile his divisive past with a new view for the future..."
 POLITICS_STYLES_BRIDGES_DESC:0 "Formerly a teacher, Styles Bridges became the youngest governor in America when he emerged victorious in the 1932 New Hampshire gubernatorial election. Bridges then entered the Senate, earning a name as a ruthless anti-Syndicalist, not above using blackmail, treachery, and deceit to achieve his goals. In one of the most infamous incidents of the early 1930s, launched a major slander campaign in an attempt to label a leading SPA Senator as a 'rampant and notorious homosexual' and a 'traitor to the moral values of our nation'. This sensationalist attack earned him the enmity of Reed and the SPA, but enamoured him with those opposed to Syndicalism. Now President, Bridges can turn his attention to stopping Syndicalism around the globe."
 POLITICS_HIRAM_JOHNSON_DESC:0 "Born in the mid-century in Sacramento, California, Hiram Johnson came from a political family. Hiram's father, Grove Johnson, was a disgraced state representative, his mother was heavily involved in the Daughters of the American Revolution. Hiram's early political career was boosted by this legacy, and he became a competent DA for San Francisco in 1902. Hiram's gubernatorial race in 1910 was funded by the liberal Republican group 'the Lincoln-Roosevelt League' Johnson's campaign ran in opposition to the Southern Pacific Railroad corporation, who sought to lobby within the Republicans against Hiram. As Governor, Hiram supported anti immigration bills, and paved the way for a later Congressional career. The Republican establishment in California was rocked in 1932, when Hiram threw in his support for Herbert Hoover. Hiram's personal distaste for the Eastern Establishment meant he stayed away from the political chaos of 1936."

### Ideas ###
 USA_militarism:0 "American Militarism"
 USA_militarism_desc:0 "Still reeling from the devastating Second American Civil War, the American military has become more than ever. In the years following the war, numerous rebel holdouts in the rust belt and the deep south persisted, requiring a large amount of American military resources to put them down. Now however, even with the Civil War very much over, the Entente still sits on the border, surrounding the nation. In order to deter any form of aggression, the United States needs to maintain a large standing army."

 USA_civil_rights:0 "The Civil Rights Act of 1956"
 USA_civil_rights_desc:0 "Like the first American Civil War, in the reconstruction following the second, there was a wave of major social changes. This came in the form of the Civil Rights Act passed by Congress in 1956. First drafted by Douglas MacArthur in the late 1940s, the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s that captivated the nation put pressure on the federal government to finally pass the legislation. As a result, most of the segregationist policies against Black Americans, that permiated throughout the south before the war, ended.

 USA_revived_monroe_doctrine_desc:0 "Established by President James Monroe in 1823, the Monroe Doctrine was a warning to the imperial powers in Europe that any intervention in the Western Hemisphere, especially through colonial expansion, would be seen as a direct threat to the United States. Since then, the Americas were firmly placed in an American sphere of influence. This collapsed during the Second American Civil War, with the Canadian and French led Entente seizing the Panama Canal. While the USA recovered from the conflict, numerous Latin American nations turned to the Entente. As Entente US tensions rise, it has become important to restablished America's back yard and kick the Entente out."
 
 USA_entente_tensions:0 "Entente Tensions"
 USA_entente_tensions_desc:0 "In recent years, the United States and the Entente nations of the United Kingdom and France have become fierce adversaries. This is mainly due to the presence of Canada, which greatly industrialised in the 1920s and 30s, as well as the strong influence the Entente has in the Caribbean. The British control of the Panama Canal, has also not helped ease tensions. With both sides wielding massive nuclear arsenls, any suspicious action by either side causes a great deal of anxiety amongst the higher ups."
 
 USA_civilwar:0 "Legacy of the Second American Civil War"
 USA_civilwar_desc:0 "While the United States Armed Forces led by MacArthur were able to unite the states once more, it has become an even more difficult task uniting the American public. While figures like MacArthur are now viewed by many in the same vain as George Washington or Abraham Lincoln, there are still some who activly despise him and the federalist victory. This can come in the form of simple protests or domestic terrorist attacks in major cities. Whatever it be, it is clear that it will be a long time until the United States of American is truly united once again."

 USA_a_more_perfect_union_desc:0 "The goal of the United States as an independent nation is to form a more perfect union of the people of the United States.

 USA_business_subsidies_desc:0 "Small businesses in America have struggled to expand their employment opportunities, which is contributing to unemployment.

Congress has approved of a federal purse to subsidise small businesses."
 USA_rebuild_americas_industry:0 "Rebuild America's Industry"
 USA_rebuild_americas_industry_desc:0 "America's exports have fallen during the depression despite taking a laissez-faire position on trade laws. Exports are also one of the main ways we measure economic activity. We must invest in the tertiary services our industrial businesses use in order to lower their bottom line and increase output."
 USA_economic_investments:0 "Economic Investments"
 USA_economic_investments_desc:0 "A more bold strategy is devised by Congress to assist in economic recovery. Traditional notions that government purchases are negatively associated with growth, newer theories hold that smart purchases can stimulate the economy."

 USA_trial_of_american_companies_desc:0 "It is time for Congress to hear the testimony of the rebellious companies.

This would allow the government to prosecute individual shareholders as responsible for decisions made."
 USA_esmwt:0 "Fate of the Unions"

 USA_american_industry:0 "American Industrial Might"
 USA_american_industry_desc:0 "The war may have temporarily reinvigorated heavy industry, but its design was temporary and facilities were essentially built on top of closed factories. We must bring our safety and management efficiencies to bear in order to make this upswing permanent."
 USA_rebuild_agriculture:0 "Rebuild Agricultural Industry"
 USA_rebuild_agriculture_desc:0 "In order to transport and process the food to feed our nation, we must encourage innovative preservation and agronomy sciences. Congress has set up a fund to investigate this and several politicians have contributed to it directly."

### Post Civil War - Macarthur ###
 USA_american_caesar_desc:0 "President MacArthur has proclaimed he would not concede victory to the very partisans who caused the civil war.

Elimination of unnecessary politicians and appointment of more competent officials will bridge the gap between people and politics."
 USA_army_education:0 "Army Education"
 USA_army_education_desc:0 "Parents' organisations have come out to claim we willingly let children into the military underage. Our solution is to divert prospective youth into military education while keeping them in public school.

 USA_nationalize_boy_scouts:0 "National Youth Administration"
 USA_nationalize_boy_scouts_desc:0 "The simultaneous pull to mandate a higher working age is countered by the multitudes of unemployed youth strewn across America. The solution is to establish a National Youth Administration in order to provide work and education to Americans too young to vote."
 USA_the_american_legion:0 "The American Legion"
 USA_the_american_legion_desc:0 "With the American Legion National Commander Smedley Butler now a fugitive, it is necessary to rebuild the organisation to remove the stain of partisan politics.

 USA_americanism:0 "Loyal to the Flag"
 USA_americanism_desc:0 "Unlike the tyrants and despots that are common in the Americas, MacArthur desires not to be a Great Man, but to be a respected and mortal leader of Americans. Loyalty to the unchanging ideal of America must be put above himself, so long as MacArthur's popularity holds out."
 USA_martial_law:0 "Martial Law"
 USA_martial_law_desc:0 "At Congressional approval, habeas corpus is suspended in accordance with the constitution.

 USA_fbi_cointelpro:0 "Second American Protective League"
 USA_fbi_cointelpro_desc:0 "As the largest part of the Continuous United States has been pacified, it is essential that American citizens remain vigilant.

 USA_control_congress:0 "Control Congress"
 USA_control_congress_desc:0 "Many former Democrats and Republicans have folded into MacArthur's new regime, while holdouts have fled.

 USA_office_of_war_information_desc:0 "Cryptographic machines designed to interact with its sender to create an encryption that cannot be easily broken are the newest toy in our arsenal.

 USA_allien_sedition_acts:0 "Executive Order 7250-A"
 USA_allien_sedition_acts_desc:0 "An Executive Order signed by President MacArthur hopes to bring an end the threat of foreign infiltration. This order restores some parts of the Alien and Sedition Act, notorious in the early 1800s. State legislations are already appealing cases to the Supreme Court. It is firmly believed, however, that MacArthur's new judges will side in his favour."
 USA_empower_the_army:0 "Empower the Army"
 USA_empower_the_army_desc:0 "Crisis has already arisen in our new military administration. The Army and Navy are constantly at each other's throats over funding and political kickbacks. We need to relegate the Navy to a secondary governmental position and grant the Army full power."
 USA_loyal_officers:0 "Old Soldiers Never Die"
 USA_loyal_officers_desc:0 "The new regime recognises the long struggle of the officers that left their homes to protect their nation, and to the many that didn't return home. Thanks to an Executive Order, officers may now pursue a technical education in universities or go into law. This will ensure loyalty long after we fade away."
 USA_loyalty_to_macarthur:0 "The Commander-in-Chief"
 USA_loyalty_to_macarthur_desc:0 "The role of the President as Commander-in-Chief goes back to President Washington. Washington set the precedent of retiring from active duty upon taking office, which MacArthur promises he will do once the national emergency is ended. Like Washington, MacArthur will remain ready to respond to threats to the nation."
 USA_national_rehabilition:0 "National Rehabilitation"
 USA_national_rehabilition_desc:0 "The creeds of Long and Reed were wrong: it was not the industrialists and businessmen that caused civil strife, but the greedy career politician that gave them posts and took their money. We shall rehabilitate the capitalists to their proper position in American society."
 USA_root_out_traitors:0 "Root out Traitors"
 USA_root_out_traitors_desc:0 "Our intelligence services have identified the enablers of radicalism and greed in America. They are the disloyal Prohibitionists, Grangers, Holy Rollers and foreigners that enabled the AFP and SPA to grow. These organisations have been rightfully banned for their implicit betrayal."
 USA_loyalty_to_america:0 "Loyalty to America"
 USA_loyalty_to_america_desc:0 "Nationalism has the goal of strengthening loyalty to the idea of America more than any American as a person. President MacArthur has chosen to refocus attention from himself to the nation as an object of admiration. No longer will a politician's ego exceed their stature, as the nation is mightier than he."
 USA_american_stratocracy:0 "American Stratocracy"
 USA_american_stratocracy_desc:0 "MacArthur has finally restored nationalist fervour and functional democracy as he sees it. While some complain that career politicians have been replaced by officers, few will argue that the bureaucracy hasn't improved. The American people can now trust their politicians to use legal means to achieve their goals."

 USA_reintroduce_gwbill_desc:0 "While originally vetoed in 1932, the economic situation in America has deteriorated to the point where unemployment relief efforts are seen as the only way to prevent widespread collapse. President Hoover has indicated to the Democrats in Congress that, this time, he will not veto the Garner-Wagner relief bill."
 USA_gwbill_fails:0 "The Bill Fails"

 USA_macarthur_plan:0 "MacArthur's Plan"
 USA_macarthur_plan_desc:0 "General MacArthur has raised a solid point: New York City and Texas are two of our most vital, and vulnerable, strongholds. MacArthur has a plan which could see one of these areas secured, should the violence escalate to a full civil war."
 USA_gwbill_succeeds:0 "The Bill Passes"
 USA_gwbill_succeeds_desc:0 "The Garner-Wagner bill has been passed! This is good news for America's economy - though now we must find ways to fund the bill, or the good news isn't going to last."
 USA_new_shipyards:0 "Shipyard Funding Scheme"
 USA_new_shipyards_desc:0 "Two major shipbuilding companies are vying for federal relief funding, and the one we select could mean a large number of new jobs in the region. The trouble is: which one do we focus on?"
 USA_hawking_plan:0 "The Hawking Plan"
 USA_hawking_plan_desc:0 "A junior Democratic Senator has proposed a plan which would see the Garner-Wagner bill funded by increased corporate income taxes. The plan is controversial with some, but it just might give the economy the boost it needs."

 USA_demand_repayment:0 "Demand Repayment of War Debts"
 USA_demand_repayment_desc:0 "The United Kingdom incurred an enormous war debt to us during the Weltkrieg. That debt has been inherited by Canada. While it's unlikely Canada could repay it right now, demanding repayment will appease isolationists in Congress, whom we believe will join the political fringe if not appeased."
 USA_reconciliation_with_canada:0 "Reconciliation with Canada"
 USA_reconciliation_with_canada_desc:0 "The isolationists are elated, but at the cost of our relations with Canada. We can try rebuilding those relations by offering a compromise: some assistance from Canada now, with the debt deferred until after the war. In exchange, we'll reduce the import tariffs from the Entente."
 USA_pass_tariff_act:0 "Pass the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act"
 USA_pass_tariff_act_desc:0 "Canada refused to repay the war debts - unsurprisingly - and thus in return our only option is to pass punitive tariffs on Entente goods imported into the US. That will put some money in our coffers, though repairing relations with Canada will take a long, long time."

 USA_old_order_prevails:0 "The Old Order Prevails"
 USA_old_order_prevails_desc:0 "Despite the challenge presented by the America First Party and the Socialist Party of America, the two-party system has managed to hold onto the presidency. The question facing the United States now is whether that will be enough to maintain peace."
 USA_velvet_glove:0 "The Velvet Glove"

 USA_company_bailouts:0 "Direct Economic Intervention"
 USA_company_bailouts_desc:0 "The way out of the Great Depression is by offering a bailout to corporations, as well as mandating a bank holiday to allow them time to stabilise. If the corporations are healthy, they can put America back to work and correct this market irregularity."
 USA_offer_fair_deal:0 "Austerity through the Storm"
 USA_offer_fair_deal_desc:0 "Austerity measures on government agencies and increased taxes are the way out of the Great Depression. This means combatting both the AFP and the SPA to see such measures passed and enforced."
 USA_iron_fist:0 "The Iron Fist"
 USA_iron_fist_desc:0 "Enough diplomacy! The Socialist Party of America and America First are purely secessionist groups whose organisation must be ended at any cost."
 USA_president_long:0 "President Long"
 USA_president_long_desc:0 "The impossible has occurred and America First have gained the presidency. The AFP does not, however, have control over Congress or the House of Representatives, and Huey Long faces both a wary legislature and a country on the verge of utter chaos."
 USA_pass_relief_bill:0 "Pass the Relief Bill"
 USA_pass_relief_bill_desc:0 "Long's first priority must be to offer relief to the numerous unemployed Americans oppressed by the Great Depression, even if it must be delivered via a presidential Executive Order. The Relief Bill is the first step in implementing the Share Our Wealth program."
 USA_fight_anarchists:0 "Fight the Anarchists"
 USA_fight_anarchists_desc:0 "Long's dreams of sharing the wealth cannot be achieved so long as the SPA has a choke-hold on American labour with the general strike ongoing since the beginning of the year. They must be brought down before America can live."
 USA_president_reed:0 "President Reed"

### Events - Pre Election ###

 ustates.1.t:0 "The United States in 1936"
 ustates.1.d:0 "In 1936, the United States of America is gripped by unrelenting crisis. Although able to avoid the horrors of the Weltkrieg, which allowed its prosperity to continue well into the 1920s, German victory in the Weltkrieg, followed by the French and British Revolutions, led to the Wall Street crash of 1925. This sent the United States spiralling into the Great Depression and allowed the Berlin Stock Market to take its place at the forefront of the world economy.\n\nThe election of Herbert Hoover in 1928, while initially promising, failed entirely to reverse the decline of the American economy, and by 1936 the country had spent over a decade in the midst of the worst financial crisis it had ever seen. This fuelled the rise of radical parties in America from the far-left Socialist Party of America, to the far-right America First Party. Hoover's contentious re-election by means of the House of Representatives in 1932, and the ongoing Great Depression means that these problems are unlikely to be resolved any time soon. Many throughout the country fear the upheaval that would result should one of the extreme parties come to power, or should the Depression continue unabated."
 ustates.1.a:0 "God Bless America."

 ustates.2.t:0 "Black Monday Hits America"
 ustates.2.d:0 "Despite the political turmoil and ineffectual economic relief programs, it seemed to many as if the economy of the United States might finally be undergoing a slow recovery after the Wall Street Crash of 1925. Black Monday has put an end to such hopes, and has sounded the death-knell for an already ailing economy. Republicans and Democrats have both pledged to fix the economy should they win the election, though public confidence in them is rapidly waning. Both Reed and Long have railed hard against the corrupt banking and political sectors, which they blame for allowing the crash to happen."
 ustates.2.a:0 "This is just not our year."

 ustates.3.t:0 "The Coalition Ticket?"
 ustates.3.d:0 "The 1936 election is looking to be one of the most contentious in American history. Many politicians within the upper circle of the Republican and Democratic Parties fear that a victory by the Socialist Party of America or the America First Party would mean the end of America and the American way of life.\n\nIn order to avoid this, a plan has been proposed within the halls of power to form a coalition ticket between the Republican and Democratic Parties with Farmer-Labor Governor Floyd Olson of Minnesota as the presidential candidate. This plan is unlikely to be popular with lower ranking members of the parties, but it may be the only thing that can prevent the radical parties from gaining strength."
 ustates.3.a:0 "A Coalition, if you can keep it."
 ustates.3.b:0 "A Coalition would debase the democratic system."

 ustates.4.t:0 "Southern Democrats Complain"
 ustates.4.d:0 "Although the coalition is showing signs of success, there is already some dissent from the various factions. The loudest voices belong to those of the Southern Democrats, many of whom are much more conservative and are facing stiff competition from the America First Party candidates. The coalition has been largely dominated by northern Democrats and Republicans, with Farmer-Labor being the third wing of the coalition. We could try and force a compromise by promising to appoint southern Democrats to the cabinet and other positions of power if we win. Of course, we could also ignore their protest and focus on winning the election instead."
 ustates.4.a:0 "Let them complain, where else will they go?"
 ustates.4.b:0 "Promise to appoint them to the cabinet."

 ustates.5.t:0 "Disunity within the Coalition"
 ustates.5.d:0 "The Democratic and Republican parties have long been at odds since they came to national prominence. As we try to keep our coalition party together, a number of Democrats and Republicans have been getting into verbal shouting matches in Congress. While they are just minor members, the conflict could destabilise the whole coalition if it is allowed to spread. We can either come down hard on one side, or try to force some kind of compromise by pressuring rabble rousers to keep still until after the election – either way, it should end public dissent for now."
 ustates.5.a:0 "Side with the Democrats."
 ustates.5.b:0 "Force a compromise."
 ustates.5.c:0 "Side with the Republicans."

 ustates.6.t:0 "Olson's Nomination"
 ustates.6.d:0 "In a massive rally in Sacramento with leading members from the Republican, Democratic and Farmer-Labor Parties, Governor Olson himself came out to accept his nomination as the National Unity presidential candidate. This massive rally has been surprisingly well received by the press and those attending it. Hopefully, it can translate to election results."
 ustates.6.a:0 "Let us pray that this helps us."

 ustates.7.t:0 "Disunity within the Coalition"
 ustates.7.d:0 "In Iowa, a number of Farmer-Labor members have gotten into a conflict with the Republicans. The Republicans are accusing Farmer-Labor of alienating people needed to win the election while Farmer-Labor is accusing the Republicans of not pushing for the policies needed to end the Depression. This fighting is driving a wedge in the coalition."
 ustates.7.a:0 "Side with the Republicans."
 ustates.7.b:0 "Force a compromise."
 ustates.7.c:0 "Side with Farmer-Labor."

 ustates.8.t:0 "Nominating Quentin Roosevelt"
 ustates.8.d:0 "Since the nomination of Governor Olson as the presidential candidate, the politically minded have discussed with great interest the likely vice-presidential candidate. Finally putting the rumours to rest, Quentin Roosevelt was announced as the VP for the coalition ticket yesterday in New York City. In his announcement, he emphasised wanting to help bring major reforms to the country through a plan called the Fair Deal. Though this plan was denounced by the SPA and AFP as being nowhere near enough to help the average American, economists believe that it may be enough to end the Depression."
 ustates.8.a:0 "A deal that is fair and a deal that is square."

 ustates.9.t:0 "Indian Citizenship Act"
 ustates.9.d:0 "In order to gain more sympathy from the North and the West, it has been proposed by the Senate and the House that the Indian Citizenship Bill be passed, effectively elevating all indigenous peoples of the United States from second-class citizens to full citizens. Northeastern and Western politicians in both the major parties support this, while some Southern Democrats and Northern Republicans have deemed it frivolous."
 ustates.9.a:0 "Pass the Act, hopefully, this will gain us some sympathy!"
 ustates.9.b:0 "Veto the Bill, this is no time for populism."

 ustates.10.t:0 "The Coalition Falls Apart!"
 ustates.10.d:0 "The conflicts within the National Unity Party have spiralled out of control and today it seems that the coalition party cannot stand together in Congress. The Republicans, Democrats and Farmer-Labor have all gone their separate ways back to their old rhetoric. The ever-present Capitol rumour mill has it that General Douglas MacArthur could save America, should either Reed or Long take over."
 ustates.10.a:0 "God save America, for nobody else can..."

 ustates.11.t:0 "Increasing Radicalisation"
 ustates.11.d:0 "With the Democrats and Republicans fighting among themselves, as usual, more and more Americans are feeling alienated from the traditional big two and are flocking to the radical AFP and SPA throughout the country. In these dark times, the distinction between genuine social reform and graft is hard to distinguish. Those under the radical banner in their political enclaves have received some social welfare. Share Our Wealth donations from the AFP, and International Red Aid from the SPA. The party machine of these radicals utilises mass media to a much stronger degree than either the Republicans or Democrats. It is looking more and more like the 1936 election will come down to Reed or Long."
 ustates.11.a:0 "This is really bad."

 ustates.12.t:0 "Farmer-Labor Flocks to the SPA"
 ustates.12.d:0 "Minnesota, which has long been a bastion of the Farmer-Labor Governor Floyd Olson, has finally flipped. Many people are turning away from Governor Olson on the direction of the IWW and SPA. Various unions have held rallies for the SPA, and attendance far outstrips our ability to out-shout them."
 ustates.12.a:0 "Is it something in the water?"

 ustates.13.t:0 "Southern Democrat Voters Align with the AFP"
 ustates.13.d:0 "The South has long been considered the heartland of the Democratic Party, but this may not be the case for much longer, as polls show a massive spike in voter registration for the AFP. On a radio broadcast, Huey Long spoke at length about Share Our Wealth and his plans for America. It seems that the AFP is growing stronger by the day."
 ustates.13.a:0 "What devious conmen."

 ustates.14.t:0 "MacArthur speaks to Hoover"
 ustates.14.d:0 "MacArthur has spoken to President Hoover privately about a contingency plan called War Plan White, a military plan for dealing with a possible armed uprising of US citizens. The plan would call on MacArthur to take emergency action to protect the country, and re-erect old barricades in Washington D.C. This plan can be engaged even from outside Washington D.C, at the Washington Arsenal. While the plan has obviously not been made public, we at least have it as a contingency if the radicals enact one of their revolutions from within government."
 ustates.14.a:0 "Let us hope this is not needed."

 ustates.15.t:0 "The Battle of the Overpass"

The drought is continuing, and over 3,000 reported deaths have been linked to it. Many people are suffering from heat stroke and heat exhaustion.

Believing that the corrupt financial sector was primarily responsible for creating and prolonging the Depression, Reed has moved to nationalise the banks of Wall Street to force them to act in the public, rather than the private, good. This includes stopping banks from foreclosing on bankrupt homeowners. A filibuster by Senator Roosevelt has forced Reed to resort to an Executive Order, appealing yet again to national security.

President Long has now called in his Minutemen to work with the National Guard to enforce his laws."
 ustates.61.a:0 "Send in the big boys"

 ustates.62.t:0 "The Minutemen Clash with the SPA"
 ustates.62.d:0 "When the Minutemen arrived in the Steel Belt to enforce the laws of the President, they were immediately set upon by members of the SPA and its supporters. Shoot-outs quickly became commonplace, and the violence quickly spread throughout almost every major city in the Steel Belt. It has been quickly noticed that the government has no remaining authority within the Steel Belt."
 ustates.62.a:0 "Send in the biggest guys we've got!"

 ustates.63.t:0 "MacArthur and the Army Remove Long"
 ustates.63.d:0 "Long's support in Washington, D.C. has finally bottomed out. Douglas MacArthur marched on the White House today with National Guard and Army units to 'restore order', having declared Long to be 'incapable of properly carrying out the functions of a constitutional president' and attempted to arrest him at the White House. MacArthur's marchers reminded many in D.C. of Cox's Army of 1932, except that these soldiers are motivated to preserve the status quo instead of smashing it, and were cheered instead of booed. Having been tipped off by AFP informants in MacArthur's command staff, however, President Long was able to stay ahead of General MacArthur's men and has escaped the capital by motorcade. MacArthur has chosen to inhabit the White House and coordinate an investigation into Long from the Oval Office. Some are even suggesting that, should Vice President William Lemke prove equally 'incapable', General MacArthur might be sworn in as provisional president."
 ustates.63.a:0 "My allegiance was to the Republic, MacArthur, to democracy!"

### President Olson ###

 ustates.64.t:0 "Floyd B. Olson's Inauguration"
 ustates.64.d:0 "After his election, Olson addressed the nation. Olson called for patience and civility in these difficult times. Olson was quoted as saying 'A nation cannot be preserved which does not preserve its citizens. Industry is reducing wages, lowering the standard of living, destroying buying power, this cannot be the way we solve our economic problems.' Reinvigorated with the news that his stomach cancer is in remission, Olson boldly strides into the White House amidst protests from both the socialists and hard liners with the promise of fixing the economy, restoring national brotherhood, and preventing political violence by any means necessary. Whether the rest of the nation would listen to the message was another story."
 ustates.64.a:0 "America is One Nation Indivisible!"

 ustates.65.t:0 "Olson Announces Negotiations"
 ustates.65.d:0 "President Olson has announced that his first priority as president is to end the strike launched by the SPA, and that he has sent an invitation to sit down with Jack Reed in Chicago to negotiate. Reed holds a firm grip over both the IWW and AFL, who make up the bulk of the general strikers. Some reporters believe that Olson's cabinet members are opposed to the talks, seeing any negotiation as political suicide - the coalition was formed, after all, in order to bypass having to directly deal with the SPA - but President Olson is, apparently, quite determined."
 ustates.65.a:0 "This is the only way"

 ustates.66.t:0 "Reed Accepts Invitation"
 ustates.66.d:0 "Jack Reed has sent word to the government that he has accepted the invitation to negotiate. FBI intelligence on Reed indicates that, should Reed fail in negotiation, the leaders of the AFL are likely to leave the general strike and defect from the SPA. While preparations are being made in Chicago to heighten security, members of Olson's cabinet as well as General Douglas MacArthur have expressed their serious misgivings at the entire endeavour. They say President Olson is putting his life in jeopardy, but for now they will wait to see what comes of the meeting."
 ustates.66.a:0 "I survived cancer, I can handle this"

 ustates.67.t:0 "Negotiations Begin"
 ustates.67.d:0 "Olson gave a stirring speech stating his plan before the negotiations. 'Today we are endeavouring to save the system we call Capitalism, by attempting to curb selfish individualism, and the avaricious profit motive. That there will be anything left of the so-called capitalistic system, is very doubtful. That there will be great change is certain.' President Olson and Jack Reed have now sat down for their historic meeting in Chicago, though before the meeting can even begin word has arrived that Huey Long has demanded the America First Party be involved in the negotiations. The presence of Long in the meeting will undoubtedly make negotiations more difficult, possibly scuttling them entirely, but refusing Long could incite his supporters in the south and make success in Chicago worthless."
 ustates.67.a:0 "Allow Long to participate"
 ustates.67.b:0 "Long has no business here"

 ustates.68.t:0 "Reed Demands SPA-Controlled Social Security"
 ustates.68.d:0 "After several days of negotiations, President Olson and Jack Reed have come to terms. In order for Reed to call off the strike, he wants to see Congress immediately pass bills mandating a liveable minimum wage, a maximum 40-hour work week, and a federally-funded welfare system directly under the SPA's administration. He fell short of demanding trade unions be required to have a percentage of seats reserved in Congress, but only reluctantly. Even so, Olson believes the bill will be a hard sell in Capitol Hill. It is, however, likely the only way to avoid further conflict."
 ustates.68.a:0 "We'll see how Congress feels about this"
 ustates.68.b:0 "Reed needs to make a better offer"

 ustates.69.t:0 "AFP and SPA Congressmen Leave Congress"
 ustates.69.d:0 "As President Olson took Reed's proposal before Congress, Huey Long and the AFP declared him a traitor to the American people for selling out welfare relief to the SPA. AFP Senators walked out, refusing to listen to Olson's impassioned plea that they compromise for the sake of peace. Those who remained listened uneasily, and as debate began it quickly became clear that the coalition would not hold in the face of socialist reforms. Even SPA Senators have now abandoned Capitol Hill, depriving both houses of a quorum, with Jack Reed declaring Olson's offer worthless and his government too corrupt and dysfunctional to ever serve the American people."
 ustates.69.a:0 "We tried, Dear America"

 ustates.70.t:0 "Long and Reed Argue"
 ustates.70.d:0 "As the meeting in Chicago began in earnest, it quickly became clear that Huey Long and Jack Reed were not going to find middle ground. Both men had contradictory views on almost all subjects, and this led to heated arguments. It is apparent from the proceedings that Reed and Long's control over their parties were waning, as both made frequent breaks to confer with their team. President Olson did his best to keep things civil, but Long and Reed could agree on nothing. Long pushed back at the every measure Reed brought up, save for social security. Jack Reed has threatened to leave the negotiations if Long is not removed."
 ustates.70.a:0 "Remove Long from the meeting"
 ustates.70.b:0 "Try to work with both the men"

 ustates.71.t:0 "Long Ejected from Negotiations"
 ustates.71.d:0 "President Olson called for Huey Long to be physically removed - which was necessary, since the man refused to leave peacefully. Moments later, Long forced his way back into the meeting hall and accused Olson of selling out welfare relief to the syndicates. In a fever pitch, Long began reciting anti-capitalist quotes Olson had made during his tenure as Governor of Minnesota. The president had little choice but to have security forces drag Long from the building, kicking and screaming, shouting that America would not stand for this treachery."
 ustates.71.a:0 "Nobody can negotiate in that state"

 ustates.72.t:0 "Minutemen Attack the SPA in Chicago"
 ustates.72.d:0 "After Huey Long was forcibly removed from the negotiations, Minutemen attacked members of the SPA party in the street just outside the building. An impromptu battle erupted as armed Minutemen clashed with Red Guard and Federal forces. Fearing for his safety, and more than a little suspicious this was all simply a ruse to see him assassinated and blame placed on the AFP, Jack Reed fled the building... followed shortly by President Olson, who was taken to Washington out of security concerns. The negotiations have ended in disastrous failure."
 ustates.72.a:0 "Long has ruined peace!"

 ustates.73.t:0 "The Compromise: Establish the NLB"
 ustates.73.d:0 "After even more long days of talks between President Olson and Jack Reed, during which several times the entire SPA delegation almost up and left the negotiations, a further compromise has been reached - one the SPA say they will not budge further upon. They have given way on SPA administration over the welfare system, but in return want federal funding for a new organisation... including a national board acting as liaison between unions and the government, one which the SPA *would* be in control of. This new liaison would be named the National Labor Board, or NLB for short. Negotiators feel this package could pass Congress, but not without inciting AFP rage and potentially undoing all efforts to contain them in the South. The only possible way around that, according to advisors, is to bring Long and the AFP into negotiations now and get them on board prior to going public."
 ustates.73.a:0 "Present this before Congress now"
 ustates.73.b:0 "Bring in Long - we need the AFP's support"

 ustates.74.t:0 "NLB Bill Narrowly Approved"
 ustates.74.d:0 "In an emergency session of Congress, President Olson - with Senator Jack Reed beside him - presented the compromise bill for the NLB before the gathered Senators. He made an impassioned plea, saying that he did not seek a full ratification. That could come in the months ahead. What he needed was a vote indicating that the larger goals in the bill were acceptable to Congress, as a message to the strikers that the federal government intended to act in good faith. While every AFP Senator left the building in outrage, refusing to take part in what they declared a 'surrender to syndicalism', Olson's plea that the coalition hold and consider the need for peace had its intended effect: at five minutes to midnight, the Senate narrowly passed a motion of approval. Jack Reed, greatly relieved, said the SPA would now relay the good news to strikers... then the real talks could begin."
 ustates.74.a:0 "A sane, democratic change"

 ustates.75.t:0 "AFP Rejects the Compromise"
 ustates.75.d:0 "As expected, Huey Long has gone on a rampage the moment news of the compromise went public. He has declared Olson to be in league with Reed, the government to have failed in its mission to guard the United States against syndicalist interests, and that America's very soul was in jeopardy. While government officials attempted to urge calm, Long's words have struck a chord across the South, firing up AFP support and - as advisors had warned the President - undoing previous efforts to contain them."
 ustates.75.a:0 "If Long wants a fight, he's got one"

 ustates.76.t:0 "Negotiations Reach Impasse"
 ustates.76.d:0 "Huey Long and the AFP gladly accepted the President's invitation to come to the negotiating table, though they were less than pleased once presented with the proposed reforms. After several days of debate, the effort largely seems to have been for naught. Jack Reed and Huey Long argue incessantly on key points of the compromise, and Long's default position is one of hostility towards what he felt as a united front against him. Still, there are points in common between the AFP's and SPA's position, and as the days wear on President Olson is becoming hopeful there may be signs of Long's resistance slowly wearing down. For the sake of peace, could he be persuaded to accept the terms?"
 ustates.76.a:0 "We only need a few more days..."

 ustates.77.t:0 "MacArthur and the Army Remove Olson"
 ustates.77.d:0 "It appears Olson's time has run out. With the perception outside the Chicago meeting being that it is dragging on for too long, while the AFP and SPA continue to gain power, Olson's own cabinet has lost its confidence that any resolution would be reached. With the cabinet's cooperation, Chief of Staff General Douglas MacArthur took charge of an emergency administration intended to 'preserve the country from extremist forces, before it's too late'. Jack Reed and Huey Long have fled the Chicago meeting, both believing they have been utterly betrayed by a federal government that would act while their guard was down. Meanwhile, President Olson has been placed under house arrest in Washington. Attempts to similarly arrest Vice President Roosevelt, still engaged in talks in Seattle, have been rebuffed by the Governor of Washington. While the government is attempting to reassure the American public that all is under control, most are looking on in shock. Civil war appears imminent."
 ustates.77.a:0 "So it has come to this"

 ustates.78.t:0 "President Announces Hard Line"
 ustates.78.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] today announced that a hard line would be taken against the SPA strikers, and indeed against any extremist force that seeks to further destabilise America. Executive Orders have been issues to curb the ability of the America First Party and the Socialist Party of America to operate, this despite protests from congressmen in both parties. All SPA and AFP Senators have now walked out of Capitol Hill, to the jeers of their Republican and Democratic colleagues, thus adding to the sense that the country was nearing a political breaking point."
 ustates.78.a:0 "We will restore order, no matter what"

 ustates.79.t:0 "Reed Condemns Police Violence"
 ustates.79.d:0 "As the SPA strike continues, spreading outside of the Steel Belt, clashes between strikers and the police have becomes more common. Jack Reed has urged the AFL and IWW strikers to resist without violence, but this hasn't always worked - especially when the strikers are simultaneously provoked by America First supporters. Reed has publicly condemned the government for adding to the violence, rather than protecting those who need it most. 'What these workers need are jobs that don't exploit them, that don't sacrifice their flesh and blood upon the altar of American Greed,' Reed declared in a Minneapolis speech. 'What they get instead is a government that acts at the behest of their capitalist overlords.'"
 ustates.79.a:0 "We're trying to keep order!"

 ustates.80.t:0 "Long Declares War On Tyranny"
 ustates.80.d:0 "The SPA strikers aren't the only ones feeling the heat at the hands of American police. So, too, have the Minutemen come under increased scrutiny. Several Minutemen training centers in Alabama and South Carolina were raided by police in recent days, and AFP meetings have been constantly harassed - or so Huey Long has loudly complained. 'The federal government has opted for open tyranny,' he said. 'They will do anything to keep us down, when what we seek is a government that is worthy of us!' His recent speech in Charlotte was received by cheering crowds, indicative of the AFP's growing influence."
 ustates.80.a:0 "We'll see about that!"

 ustates.81.t:0 "The General Strike Spreads"
 ustates.81.d:0 "The SPA's general strike has spread far and wide, all but bringing the nation to a standstill in many industrial states. The city of St. Louis in particular has become a warzone, day to day life all but ended as strikers clash variously either with Federal forces or with AFP Minutemen. The sense of chaos has led to several riots as protests by regular citizens have turned into looting and civil unrest. People are leaving St. Louis by the thousands, and are calling for immediate government intervention."
 ustates.81.a:0 "It is coming!"

 ustates.82.t:0 "Tension in the Steel Belt"
 ustates.82.d:0 "As National Guardsmen arrive in the north to end the SPA strike, tensions remain high. Many of the various mayors and even governors were not just supportive of the strike but actively helping it. Consequently, they strongly oppose the unconstitutional use of the National Guard. The strikers have begun to taunt the guards, and have even assaulted scab workers brought into the factories under National Guard escort. It is clear a single spark can set off the entire American north. President [USA.GetLeader] remains undeterred by this, and declared on the radio that the general strike must end for the good of the nation, with the unsaid implication that force will be used if it doesn't."
 ustates.82.a:0 "Force is necessary now"

 ustates.83.t:0 "Clashes in the South"
 ustates.83.d:0 "National Guard units today fought with Minutemen militia in northern Louisiana, a raid that soon turned into a bloodbath as Minutemen opened fire. In the end, over forty Guardsmen were killed as well as an unknown number of Minutemen. Huey Long and the AFP denied involvement with the militia, but questioned the presence of the National Guard in what should clearly have been a police matter. The militia, they claim, were merely defending themselves. Photos of the ensuing bloody scene have circulated in southern newspapers, resulting in a new wave of outrage from the public directed at the federal government."
 ustates.83.a:0 "But not at the Minutemen? Not even a little?"

 ustates.84.t:0 "The Pittsburgh Massacre"
 ustates.84.d:0 "All it took was a single spark to start the revolution, and in Pittsburgh that spark occurred when a crowd of people stood outside one factory determined themselves to oppose the National Guard. Guardsmen fired into the crowd leaving five dead. It did not take long for this to quickly be dubbed the 'Pittsburgh Massacre' and the Steel Belt was driven into a frenzy. Soon National Guardsmen and police were fighting with SPA militia throughout the Steel Belt. Newspapers across the country have 'civil war' splashed across their headlines, and public panic is at a crescendo."
 ustates.84.a:0 "What next?"

 ustates.85.t:0 "J. Edgar Hoover's Proposal"
 ustates.85.d:0 "J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the FBI, arrived at the White House early today to grimly inform President [USA.GetLeader] that civil war is imminent. The best chance for the federal government, he says, is to take decisive action now before the AFP and SPA can become more organised. An assassination of Huey Long would mean the collapse of the AFP, as it centred around his personality. An assassination of Jack Reed, meanwhile, would throw the SPA into disarray while the IWW and AFL competed for leadership... at least long enough for the immediate danger to pass. There would be consequences, Hoover advises, not least of all the rightful suspicion that would fall on a democratic government for taking such an extreme act... but these are desperate times. If the FBI is to act, Hoover says, they must act now, for there is only time for one operation."
 ustates.85.a:0 "Take out Jack Reed and the SPA"

 ustates.87.d:0 "Just outside the Louisiana state legislature in Louisiana, Huey Long - leader of the America First Party and prominent critic of the United States federal government - was shot to death by an assailant who, in turn, was killed by Long's bodyguards. The motives of the assassination are unknown, but while many are ascribing it to the Socialist Party of America, the SPA's leader Jack Reed has hotly denied any involvement and instead is pointing the finger at President [USA.GetLeader]... a version of events which is gaining widespread acceptance in the country, increasing the anger towards the troubled government. The former Democrats within the AFP have silently deserted the more radical elements of the party, and the FBI reports that neither William Lemke nor Charles Coughlin have been able to meet with the AFP Congressmen."
 ustates.87.a:0 "That's it for the AFP, at least"
 ustates.87.b:0 "Interesting"

A manhunt is currently under way for the sniper, even as workers across America mourn his loss. While many are ascribing the deed to the America First Party, the AFP's leader, Huey Long, has hotly denied any involvement and instead is pointing the finger at President [USA.GetLeader]... a version of events which is gaining widespread acceptance in the country, increasing the anger towards an already-troubled government. The labour leaders from the AFL have declared Reed's strike to be wildcat, and therefore have ordered their unions to return to work. The IWW has responded by declaring the AFL scabs, and it appears their brief cooperation has ended."

 ustates.89.t:0 "Reed Accuses the Government of Murder"
 ustates.89.d:0 "With the country still reeling from Huey Long's death, and the AFP collapsing, Jack Reed has been quick to capitalise on the growing public anger. At a recent rally in Detroit, Reed all but accused the government of murder. 'I won't say that I agreed with Governor Long,' he said, 'but he wanted the life of the average American to be better. He wanted a government that was better, that stood for us all. What we have now is a government that stands only for capitalist greed, a cancer growing within the heart of American democracy which will kill anything that tries to cut it out.' Demonstrations across the country have echoed Reed's words, particularly in the South where Long's supporters have begun a campaign of violence against government targets, and it seems things will quickly get worse."

At a recent rally in Alabama, Long all but accused the government of murder. 'We have been spared a devil who would have led us down the road to tyranny,' he said, 'but we must face another kind of tyranny in our own government. American democracy is dead, and it is President [USA.GetLeader] who has killed it. We must rise up and meet steel with steel, guns with guns!'

 ustates.91.d:0 "Today John Nance Garner has been sworn in as the 31st president of America. Garner's speech spoke about how we must not compromise our democratic values with radicals, left or right. Garner was quoted as saying 'We are in a tough-minded recognition that the fight for a better America is a long one.' On the economy, Garner has promised reform through personal sacrifice and austerity, as was done after the Panic of 1893. Garner enters the White House surrounded by hostile AFP and SPA Senators as well as wary Republicans, though he has assured the public that the Longists and Unionists will tire themselves out before the end of the year."
 ustates.91.a:0 "God Save America"

 ustates.92.t:0 "The Austerity Bill"
 ustates.92.d:0 "President Garner has introduced an Emergency Austerity Measures bill into Congress today, an almost certainly controversial piece of legislation which would see government spending cuts across the board - especially towards the social security net. Garner's speech to the Senate spoke of the sacrifice needed if America is to recover from the Great Depression, and it was met with mostly scepticism and jeers from non-Democratic Senators. Even Garner's own cabinet expressed reservations regarding his choice, suggesting passage of the bill might prove difficult... though, if it can be managed, it would almost certainly save the country."
 ustates.92.a:0 "Believe in America"

 ustates.93.t:0 "Long Denounces Austerity Measures"
 ustates.93.d:0 "As discussions began in Capitol Hill regarding the austerity bill, the AFP immediately denounced it. Huey Long said in a North Carolina speech that austerity did the exact opposite of what was necessary. Rather than sharing the wealth, it took every last bit of wealth from those who needed it most. Austerity, he claims, would leave the average American more desperately poor than they are now, and would leave them vulnerable to syndicalist rhetoric. Long said he would be directing AFP to oppose the bill at every turn, for the sake of the country."
 ustates.93.a:0 "We shall see"

 ustates.94.t:0 "D.C. Demonstration Turns Violent"
 ustates.94.d:0 "A demonstration in Washington D.C. by workers and strikers voicing their disapproval of the austerity measures bill, today turned violent as police attempted to break up the crowd. SPA members present said theirs was a peaceful protest, that police provoked the crowd into a response. Regardless of the cause, the end result was a pitched battle with police that left the city in chaos for two days and left hundreds of protestors injured. SPA leader Jack Reed condemned the police action as brutality and imperialist suppression."

 ustates.96.t:0 "Austerity Bill Voting Commences"
 ustates.96.d:0 "Voting on the Emergency Austerity Measures bill began in Congress today, though early indications were not good. While the bill is solidly backed by Democratic Senators, it is rabidly opposed by both the SPA and AFP... and there are enough Republican Senators remaining on the fence, unwilling to be swayed, that passage may prove unlikely without intervention. The president's cabinet is suggesting calling for a meeting of the major party representatives in Philadelphia, to try and work out a compromise - at least enough of one to make passage easier. It is also possible that President Garner could campaign for the votes of influential Republicans. A coalition may not have been in the cards, but perhaps he could appeal to their sense of civic duty on this one instance alone?"
 ustates.96.a:0 "Arrange the Philadelphia meeting"
 ustates.96.b:0 "Let's campaign for the Republican vote"

 ustates.97.t:0 "Philadelphia Meeting Begins"
 ustates.97.d:0 "The historic meeting in Philadelphia began today, with all four major political parties present and President Garner appealing to them that a compromise on the austerity bill was necessary for the sake of national peace and prosperity. As the parties talked, however, it quickly became clear that Huey Long and Jack Reed would both absorb most of the attention. Despite the small number of congressmen they each have in Congress, everyone in the room knows very well the influence they hold in the country, and both men disagreed on almost every aspect of compromise. Reed wanted workers protected from cuts to government contracts, while Long wanted to add an Open Shop clause to austerity. While there is evidence that President Garner and Governor Long see eye-to-eye on many issues, it is quickly becoming clear that compromise will be utterly impossible with both Reed and Long present."

Moments later, he forced his way back into the meeting hall and accused Garner of throwing out fiscal responsibility for the syndicates' sake. The president had little choice but to have security forces drag Long from the building, kicking and screaming, shouting that America would not stand for this treachery.

 ustates.99.t:0 "Garner and Long Make Progress"
 ustates.99.d:0 "President Garner called for Jack Reed and the SPA to be ejected from the meeting, though before Reed left he made a solemn speech to those present. He accused them of bowing to tyranny, that a government which didn't understand the worker would meet its ultimate fate at the hand of that worker. After his departure, however, things went much more smoothly. Long indicated he was willing to make compromises, so long as amendments to the austerity bill supporting Long's Share Our Wealth Society indirectly through tax breaks. With this, as well as putting Huey Long himself as the head of a new Unamerican Activities Committee, he could go to his supporters and say that progress was finally being made. There are those present at the meeting, however, who caution that this will undoubtedly infuriate the SPA and make irrelevant any measures the government has undertaken to curb their control in the North."

 ustates.100.d:0 "Just as the remaining members of the meeting began to make headway, and it was looking as if a compromise on the austerity bill would be reached, word arrived in Philadelphia of a battle taking place in nearby Pittsburgh. SPA strikers had been attacked by Minutemen militia members, a fight which turned bloody when federal forces arrived on the scene and attempted to intervene. Several bombs were detonated, adding to the chaos, and the Senators received reports of unidentified militia forces advancing on Philadelphia. President Garner was evacuated from the building by his security forces, over his objections, and both the meeting and the vote have crumbled to a premature end."

 ustates.101.d:0 "While President Garner's attempt to get Huey Long and Jack Reed to come to some kind of agreement was commendable, after several days of debate it appears to have mostly come to naught. Both men are frustrated, and several times each has threatened to walk out of the meeting entirely. It is apparent from the proceedings that Reed and Long's control over their parties were waning, as both made frequent breaks to confer with their team. Republicans are split on the matter, and there are not enough of them who will vote for the bill if they believe the country will erupt into violence anyhow. Both Long and Reed have given a deadline until tomorrow, at which point they say there is no chance of the Philadelphia meeting continuing. The gathered Senators are looking to the president to somehow solve the impasse."

 ustates.102.t:0 "Austerity Bill Passes"
 ustates.102.d:0 "With the endorsement of the AFP, the Emergency Austerity Measures bill passed - though not before all SPA Senators up and walked out of the chamber in protest. News of the exemptions, as well as the added restrictions on industrial unions and Huey Long's presence at the head of a new committee which will likely see more crackdowns on socialist activity, has fired up SPA supporters across the Steel Belt with outrage. Jack Reed has declared the government a dead and useless body, so corrupt it could not even see Long for the snake he truly is, and says the American worker will never get a fair share unless he fights for it. Demonstrations have erupted across the northern part of the country - as suspected, making the government's efforts to combat SPA control useless - although, in the South, Long's assurances have gone a long way towards keeping his supporters quiet."

 ustates.103.d:0 "While President Garner campaigned long and hard into the night, at the end of the day there were simply too few Republican Senators willing to vote for a bill that they didn't have the support of the SPA and AFP, and which would likely result in violence anyhow. Garner's austerity plan is seen as a poor follow up to the Garner-Wagner bill he co-authored in 1934. The entire vote was even delayed by an actual fist-fight between a Republican and a AFP Senator. In the end, the vote failed by a slim margin... though the margin might as well have been a chasm, into which all of President Garner's hopes and aspirations could be tossed."

Douglas MacArthur marched into Washington D.C today, having declared Garner an 'ineffective president whose weakness has endangered America'. MacArthur's marchers reminded many in D.C. of Cox's Army of 1932, except these men are motivated to preserve the country from extremist forces. With the President returned in disgrace to his home in Texas, and Vice President Willkie still engaged in conference with unions in Seattle, Garner's own cabinet have assured the public that General MacArthur's assumption of power is necessary, and have been working with the Chief of Staff to install an emergency government from the White House - even as the majority of America looks on in shock. Civil war is imminent."

### Alf Landon Path ###

 ustates.105.t:0 "Alf Landon's Inaugural Address"
 ustates.105.d:0 "Alf Landon was sworn in as the 31st president of the United States of America today. At his inaugural address Landon spoke of the challenges facing the nation in preserving a liberal democracy. Landon was quoted as saying 'Republicans must become practical liberals, which means that the Republican party has got to recognise the problems of a growing and complex industrial civilisation. And I think I will awaken America to that.' Landon concluded with a promise to solve the Depression with entrepreneurship. Creating a new generation of millionaires that will bring pride back to the nation. Whether anyone will listen is another matter."
 ustates.105.a:0 "I treasure our American Democracy"

# Economic Intervention route
 ustates.106.t:0 "Landon Proposes Intervention"
 ustates.106.d:0 "In response to the ongoing crisis, President Landon has proposed a bill to begin a series of economic intervention policies. The bill will create an insurance for bank deposits in treasury-approved banks that will not engage in risky investing. The bill also allows the federal government to create a commission to monitor stock market exchanges against fraud. Landon believes this will restore confidence in the market, creating jobs from one end of the country to the other. Both the SPA and the AFP have declared opposition to the bill for not going far enough, and for being too friendly to the very businesses that caused the depression in the first place. It will take some cooperation between Republicans and Democrats to overcome this united front of radicalism in Congress."
 ustates.106.a:0 "This bill will not stop for them"

 ustates.107.t:0 "Reed Calls Landon Corrupt"
 ustates.107.d:0 "Alf Landon's election material made him out to be a self-made man, an entrepreneur who made his wealth starting from a small petroleum company. Landon's relationship with the oil industry culminated in the establishment of the United States Oil and Gas Association in his home state of Kansas, which freely associates with Standard Oil. To Reed and the SPA, this is the smoking gun that Landon is a class traitor, though to many these accusations have rang hollow, citing Landon as a man with the business connections to make the intervention bill stick."
 ustates.107.a:0 "I started with nothing, Reed, just like you!"

 ustates.108.t:0 "Huey Long Calls Landon a Monopolist"
 ustates.108.d:0 "Huey Long has responded, like Reed, by decrying Landon as a corrupt politician in Standard Oil's pocket. Huey Long recently spoke about how President Landon only cared for the rich and the monopolies that oppress true Americans, articulating criticism of Landon's fiscal conservatism during his tenure as Governor of Kansas. Huey Long also made sure to remind the people that, by all rights, he should be president and that he would have fixed this crisis already. President Landon, meanwhile, responded in a recent interview with newspapers that Long has a serious case of 'sour grapes', and political cartoons have begun depicting Long as a childish baboon - much to the public's amusement and Long's outrage."
 ustates.108.a:0 "I am not Rockefeller, you fool!"

 ustates.109.t:0 "Democrats Close Ranks"
 ustates.109.d:0 "While many Democratic Senators are leery of supporting a bill which has such vociferous opposition by the SPA and the AFP, especially considering their influence in America goes far beyond the number of seats they hold in Congress, they have responded poorly to the personal attacks on the president by Long and Reed. Despite internal opposition for interfering with the market, Democrats have indicated they will support the president's bill."
 ustates.109.a:0 "That's the solidarity I like"

 ustates.110.t:0 "The 'New Deal' Bill Passes"
 ustates.110.d:0 "The Economic Intervention Bill has managed to pass through Congress, and has been signed into law by President Landon. Banks are immediately shuttered as they reorganise before receiving Treasury approval. The commission has begun to draft reforms to stock trading that will hopefully restore confidence in the markets. It is hard to say right away if this will solve the problem, but Landon hopes that these can be the first steps to fix the economy, steps which all moderates can agree upon."
 ustates.110.a:0 "We are finally awake to change"

 ustates.111.t:0 "General Strike Spreads"
 ustates.111.d:0 "The SPA's general strike has spread far and wide, after a call by Jack Reed to demonstrate against the recently-passed intervention bill, all but bringing the nation to a standstill in many industrial states. The city of St. Louis in particular has become a warzone, day to day life all but ended as strikers clash variously either with Federal forces or with AFP Minutemen. The sense of chaos has led to several riots as protests by regular citizens have turned into looting and civil unrest. People are leaving St. Louis by the thousands, calling for immediate government intervention."
 ustates.111.a:0 "This is getting out of hand"

 ustates.112.t:0 "Proposed Conference with Long and Reed"
 ustates.112.d:0 "In response to the ongoing crisis, Alf Landon's Secretary of Commerce has proposed a conference with both Huey Long and Jack Reed to try to arrange some sort of compromise. The Secretary says that the measures in the bill will not work unless the strikes and the violence are brought to an end. However, some within the Republican party are saying that this plan of action will not work, and claiming a conference with Long and Reed will debase their party."
 ustates.112.a:0 "Ignore Long and Reed"
 ustates.112.b:0 "Arrange the conference"

 ustates.113.t:0 "The Great St. Louis Riot"
 ustates.113.d:0 "The SPA has been aggravating the workers in the area to expand the strike. Local businesses in St. Louis have become utterly paralysed. Many of them turned to the America First Party to provide a solution. Within days, the streets were flooded with Minutemen. There are wild reports from the chaos ranging from Minutemen stopping petty crime in the absence of police, to them creating the crime. Soon the situation had erupted into a wide scale riot. The chaos has been splashed across every newspaper in America, and within days SPA and AFP forces have begun to mobilise. War is upon us."
 ustates.113.a:0 "So it begins now, does it?"

 ustates.114.t:0 "Conference Begins"
 ustates.114.d:0 "The conference between President Landon and both Huey Long and Jack Reed began, but within days it was clear that it was a lost cause. Long and Reed argued constantly, on almost every issue, and the only thing that united them was their personal detestation of Landon and his intervention bill. It is apparent from the proceedings that Reed and Long's control over their parties were waning, not least of which is due to constant newspaper coverage of the conference citing the two men as 'obstructionist' and 'unreasonable'. Reed and Long both see the president as the corrupt tool of corporate America, and rather than compromise their demands are tantamount to rolling back the intervention bill which has already been voted on and passed through Congress! Both are nearly ready to walk out, despite the president's pleading that they compromise for the sake of peace in the country."
 ustates.114.a:0 "I have to save this conference"

 ustates.115.t:0 "Scandal Rocks the Conference"
 ustates.115.d:0 "While President Landon's conference is finally beginning to make slow progress, American newspapers turn their attention from Reed and Long to a different target: namely the revelation of an internal memo within General Motors corporation which indicates that not only is the company's planned settlement with strikers intended to be only temporary... but that they and other companies are being bribed into settlement by the federal government. A temporary setback as they make concessions to strikers in exchange for a bailout with the understanding that changes made can be easily undone. While many are denying this memo's veracity, the sensational aspect of the news is giving new fire to AFP and SPA supporters and is threatening to quickly escalate out of control."
 ustates.115.a:0 "Cut the conference short, we need to call GM"
 ustates.115.b:0 "We must keep the conference going, no matter what"

 ustates.1150.t:0 "MacArthur and the Army Remove Landon"
 ustates.1150.d:0 "While the conference continued for several days, it rapidly became evident that the scandal was not going to end - instead it was escalating as other sources came forward with similar information, much of it pointing to an insider effort engineered by President Landon himself. Both Jack Reed and Huey Long abandoned the conference, and although Landon did his best to save face in Congress it was clear that blame was being placed squarely on him for the conference's failure. With the crisis spiralling out of control, Chief of Staff General Douglas MacArthur has stepped in - apparently with the full approval of Landon's own cabinet - to install an emergency government in the White House 'to save America from extremist forces before it's too late'. President Landon has been placed under house arrest at his home in Kansas, while attempts to co-opt or arrest Vice President McNary, still engaged in talks in Seattle, have come to naught. While the government has tried to assure Americans that things are under control, it's quickly becoming clear that civil war is imminent."
 ustates.1150.a:0 "So it has come to this"


### Victory in the civil war

 ustates.116.t:0 "MacArthur's Power"
 ustates.116.d:0 "With our victory in the civil war, the question of MacArthur’s status must be decided upon. Although President MacArthur is legally the President according to the Presidential Succession Act, it was obvious to all in 1937 that MacArthur took power illegally. Many now wish for the general to step down and hand power back over to the elected vice president of the 31st administration. Hardliners within MacArthur's clique insist that the US will fall back into civil war without him, however, while Republicans and some Democrats claim MacArthur would be a tyrant if he stayed."

 ustates.118.b:0 "Malice."

 ustates.119.t:0 "The Fate of the Electoral College"
 ustates.119.d:0 "As we work to strengthen democracy following the civil war, the question of the Electoral College has been brought up. Many are calling for the end to first-past-the-post voting for state electors. This would be replaced by a more simple national popular voting system. A majority of Congress believes that we should keep FPTP around as a safeguard against radicalism in the future. What should we do?"
 ustates.119.a:0 "We shall adopt Popular Vote."
 ustates.119.b:0 "The Electoral College stays!"

 ustates.120.t:0 "National Rehabilitation"
 ustates.120.d:0 "While we root out those that continue to still fight on for their treasonous cause, the question has come before MacArthur about what to do to those that have laid down their arms. Some of his advisers are suggesting clemency others suggest they must be imprisoned for their actions. What shall the commander in chief choose?"
 ustates.120.a:0 "Down with the Traitors."
 ustates.120.b:0 "We have spilt enough blood."

 ustates.121.t:0 "Reconcile with Washington?"
 ustates.121.d:0 "The tyrant MacArthur has done the unthinkable and has stepped down from power. Thus a debate has arisen about if we should reunite and make America whole. Many believe that even though MacArthur has stepped down from power, he still has control and that he won't hesitate to re-assume power should politics don't go his way."

 ustates.122.a:0 "From Sea to shining Sea!"

 ustates.123.t:0 "No Reconciliation"
 ustates.123.d:0 "Since MacArthur stepped down many wondered if the country would be whole again. However it seems that the rebels out west have decided that they shall not reunite with us. In their senate, they denounced Congress as just being a pawn of MacArthur who they still regard as a tyrant despite the fact he saved the country."
 ustates.123.a:0 "America one day shall be reunited."

 ustates.125.t:0 "The National Labor Relations Board"
 ustates.125.d:0 "With the civil war over and reconstruction now under way, the question of trade unions have been brought up. Some think that we should promote more liberal and anti-syndicalist unions to be a ward against the influence of Syndicalism in politics. A few loyalists within the AFL and the defunct Knights of Labor are willing to cooperate with Congress in creating a National Labor Relations Board. This board would be able to isolate IWW-affiliated unions, and give collective bargaining rights to unions that do not wish to see us hang. Others however, regard all trade unions as traitors to the country and should be outlawed toggether. Congress has decided to...?"
 ustates.125.a:0 "Accept the AFL and KoL into the NLRB."
 ustates.125.b:0 "Outlaw all Unions regardless of loyalty."

 ustates.126.t:0 "Army Is Slow to Desegregate"
 ustates.126.d:0 "After the President signed a law to desegregate the Armed Forces, it seems that it is taking more time then expected to fully desegregate. There are still black only and white only regiments and several officers are determined to keep things separate. Despite the slowness, things are improving as more and more units are desegregating. Still, Progress is slow."
 ustates.126.a:0 "Desegregation shall still happen."

 ustates.127.t:0 "The Red Scare"
 ustates.127.d.macarthur:0 "Since MacArthur has taken power he has begun a campaign against socialism, anarchism, and syndicalism.

This has led to the firing of over 5,000 federal employees who were accused of being homosexual. The press have mostly approved of this measure, although a few tabloids claim we are preaching hypocrisy. One of the chief prosecutors, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, has long been rumoured to be in the closet with his secretary Clyde Tolson. As Director of the most important intelligence agency, Hoover is of course beyond investigation.

Ten years ago the place where we are gathered was a sparse, forbidding desert. In the bottom of a gloomy canyon, whose precipitous walls rose to a height of more than a thousand feet, flowed a turbulent, dangerous river. The mountains on either side of the canyon were difficult of access with neither road nor trail, and their rocks were protected by neither trees nor grass from the blazing heat of the sun. The site of Boulder City was a cactus-covered waste. The transformation wrought here in these years is a twentieth-century marvel.'

The Corvée system is a tax imposed to pay for prisoners to repair public works. President Barkley spoke out against this idea, as his time in Kentucky taught him that penal labour will never surpass contract labour.

Though the old United Kingdom was on its way to repayment, there was a tacit agreement after the British Revolution that the debts wouldn't continue to be repaid until the Home Islands were recaptured.

 ustates.600.d:0 "The defence of the United States has always been an uphill battle. Stretched thin against the vast breadth of the North American continent, the United States Army has had little chance to distinguish itself throughout its 160 year history. It won the bare minimum of victories to maintain American independence during the Revolution and the War of 1812. It performed admirably against a corrupt regime in the Mexican-American War but half of those forces would provide the seed for the fledgeling Confederate Army during the ensuing Civil War. More recently the Army performed barely adequately to subdue the heavily outgunned Spanish and struggled to suppress the half-starved Filipino Insurrection more than 30 years ago. Prevented from joining in the Weltkrieg on either side, it has suffered in both doctrine and technology, with very few tanks and a small Air Corps subsidiary to the ground forces. With the hobbled lion that was the British Empire on the northern frontier and a syndicalist stronghold poised in the south, the U.S. Army must be asked to defend the Republic from enemies within and without, and few agree that they are up to the task."

 ustates.601.d:0 "The United States Navy, long the darling child of the American defence establishment has been a strong force in global maritime affairs for nearly fifty years. A rival even to the vaunted Kaiserliche Marine and Royal Navy at their height in the Weltkrieg, it has defended America's shores and sallied forth to spread stability and democracy for nigh on 160 years. From John Paul Jones' raid on the British mainland to the Battle of Manila Bay, the Navy has provided the security needed by the republic from those that would infringe upon our independence from beyond the seas. All is not well in the modern day, however. The navy's ships are old, her flagships Weltkrieg-era dreadnoughts even as Germany and the Syndicalists engage in a new naval arms race, and the tattered remnants of the Royal Navy lick their wounds. The new dreadnoughts have been commissioned at the suggestion of senator Benjamin Tillman, along with many projects of the twenties converted to aircraft carriers due to the Great Depression, but the Navy is nowhere near ready to take on the imperial Japanese fleet. The Marine Corps fares better, hardened as they are by constant action in tropical locals, but they are small, only a few regiments strong, and are powerless to affect increasing tension at home from their far-flung island bases. The honour guard in Washington D.C. look increasingly powerless as violence in the nation's capital increases. Our White ships might dominate the waves but many question whether it will be enough to face the gathering storm on the horizon."

Luckily for us, several staff members had already been advocating for reform plans since the early 1920s, and they have been summoned by High Command to a meeting for them to lay out their plans. After a session full of army formalities, 4-Star General Malin Craig presented a restructuring and mobilisation plan which would focus on trying to arm as many men as possible while improving and enhancing the High Command to have an edge in planning over our enemies. While many conservative members applauded his traditionalist stance, Major General Adna R. Chaffee criticised his stance, quoting several instances in which planning and mass mobilisation didn't earn the victory to the French in the Weltkrieg, and instead advocating for the adoption of the 'Thunderbolt': Fast moving armies supporting themselves on motorised and mechanised elements to quickly exploit enemy weak spots. While both sides got gridlocked into a discussion for radically different plans, Major General Leslie McNair offered an alternative solution: The American strength lies with its industry, and it is clear that in order to win, that strength should be exploited to its fullest. For that he proposes the restoration of the late 1920s and early 1930s artillery examination boards and the development of anti air and anti tank batteries to counter-act any enemy developments on this front.

With the country's integrity at stake, the High Command has decided to negotiate with the Air Force Generals, and the result of the negotiations is pretty clear: The Air Branch will not stand for a continuation of the Status Quo, and demands that at best, their force is given significant autonomy from the Army and reorganise as the United States Army Air Force, and at worse for the United States Army Air Corps to be expanded and supported to suit the needs of the battlefield.

When the Douglas C-33 took off from the Langley Air Field and finally was put into position to start the experiment, Second Lieutenant William T.

Soon enough, the 501st Parachute Battalion was formed, quickly followed by other battalions and regiments. After a week recruitment, the number of volunteers was enough to form 5 paratrooper divisions for us to utilise.

The document highlights the specific capabilities of tanks that makes them a unique threat on a modern battlefield characterised by open warfare, like the tank's speed and mobility which, when combined with the lack of a stabilised front, increased the need to ensure protection of flanks and rear areas against armoured attacks.

In order to present his idea more coherently to high command, he has recently written the 'Armored Force Tentative Table of Organisation' where the Combat Command, as he describes it, should be flexible organisation that should not have dedicated battalions. Instead, tank, armoured infantry, and armoured field artillery battalions, as well as smaller units of tank destroyers, engineers, and mechanised cavalry have to be assigned as needed in order to accomplish any given mission. To achieve this, he wishes to split the armoured division into the combat commands named "A" for the main force, "B" for flank defence, and "R" for reserve units. While his concept is clearly inspired in the German 'Kampfgruppe' concept, the High Command has received his idea with open arms and are starting to implement the new organisation system across the board as well as distributing the new manual to the field officers."

 ustates.614.d:0 "One of the major lessons from the civil war was the need to enhance the speed and clarity of our communications on the front line while not making our movements and organisation system obvious to the enemy. In order to create a consistent naming system, the Army and Navy had designated a commission from the Signal Corps to work on a new radio alphabet system for our men to use, and we finally have the results from their efforts. With the publishing and distribution of the 'Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet' manual, our new alphabet shall utilise the codenames Able, Baker, Charlie, Dog, Easy, Fox, George, How, Item, Jig, King, Love, Mike, Nan, Oboe, Peter, Queen, Roger, Sugar, Tare, Uncle, Victor, William, X-ray, Yoke and Zebra. While similar radio systems have been developed for the Canadians and the Germans, the fact we have finally taken the task of standardising it means we're finally catching up with the lessons we missed in the Weltkrieg"

 ustates.615.d:0 "Ever since the Weltkrieg proved that helmets were vital to protect the infantry from flying fragments of exploded ordnance, the American Army has utilised the British Mk I helmet designed by John L. Brodie, which gave it its current nickname. While adopted, the US never saw a need to mass produce it, and instead continued to buy the model from the British in the cheap during their depression in the early 1920s. While these helmets were effective at the time, our experience in the civil war has proven that even the Brodie is no longer suitable for modern combat and, as such, a research team was created under Major Harold G. Sydenham to look for alternatives. The research team concluded that by removing the Brodie's brim, by adding side pieces and earpiece, and by incorporating the suspension system into a separate inner liner, the new helmet could provide a protection the Brodie could never afford. The original test item was known as the TS3, and it received a favourable report from the Infantry Board in the recent weeks. With the approval of the War Department, it will soon enter mass production to supply our rapidly growing army."

 ustates.616.d:0 "As thousands of new recruits flood into training camps across the country, community librarians have recognised an opportunity to lend their support to our government. Individual libraries sponsored book drives to donate to their local military bases. In the last few months, members of the American Library Association met to discuss a plan for a coordinated nationwide drive to supply the troops with free books. The ALA presented their idea to the United Service Organisations and The Red Cross, who have received their idea enthusiastically and begun setting up more than four hundred recreational clubs on the outskirts of military camps. The Red Cross wanted books to send to military hospitals, remote camps with no libraries, their overseas clubs, and prisoners of war. The two organisations decided to split the project's funding, while the ALA provided technical know-how and both began campaigning for government approval. While our military is reluctant of accepting donated books, there is a real need for entertainment for our soldiers in the field and Army high command decided to give its approval to the project."

The Campaign was unfortunately not well suited for combat units, as the bulky hardcovers were found to be unsuitable for use in the field and many of the books donated were deemed unfitting by the revision committees. From 10.827.097 books gathered in the last year, an unacceptably high percentage of these were unsuitable, with VBC staffers having discarded 5,052,858 books. While the idea is still in the air, the Army has decided to order the VBC to come to a close, but has begun plans with the CBW to create a new plan to entertain our soldiers."

With the support of the Navy Chief Librarian Isabel DuBois, the project managed to reach the Army High Command. While the proposal was sound, a clause in Trautmant's proposal sparked controversy in the High Command Meeting. As he stated that all books should be, in all circumstances, acceptable to both services, and that works with 'Statements or attitudes offensive to our Allies, any religious or racial group, or not in accord "with the spirit of American democracy"' should be discarded. Regardless of the controversy that it caused, the Army and Navy high command have agreed to give the project the green light, with both branches offering their own printing presses and the funding to expand printing further if necessary."

While Snipers proved their usefulness during the Weltkrieg, the Army high command had never seen any reason to expand upon it as it was seen as a situational solution for the battlefields of Europe. However, fighting in the American mountains, cities and forests have proved not only that they were wrong, but we have paid the price dearly for it, as we lack the means to counter-act enemy sniper operations, let alone send off snipers of our own to eliminate High Value Targets. As such, a proposal has reached High Command to kickstart one similar to the Sniper training that Canadian put their snipers through in the Weltkrieg."

While this could yield great effects hindering our enemy's industrial capabilities, the ethical implications of utilising such inhumane weapons of destruction has made many members of the staff restless on the subject, as these bombs might easily end up hitting civilians unintentionally.

First the military turned to the head of the Army’s Construction Division, Brig. Gen. Brehon Burke Somervell. He, in turn, tasked the chief of the design section, Lt. Col. Hugh J. Casey, to come up with a building that would fit a five-sided parcel of land that had been hastily purchased just below Arlington National Cemetery on the Virginia side of the Potomac River, which would house all the War Department's components. Originally the building was meant to be placed in a location known as the Arlington Farms, where the road shape resembles a Pentagon, which has forced the architect team to adapt the design to said geographic space. Many in the Department, however are questioning if positioning the building between the cemetery, which by all means is considered hallowed ground for every American, and the stunning view of Washington D.C. is really appropriate, and two new locations have been proposed for the construction. Unfortunately, the requests for the materials have already been designed to accommodate a pentagonal shape, so even if we were to change the building location, the building will still be made in that shape, but we still need to decide where should the Pentagon be."

 USA_DOUGLAS_MACARTHUR_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L 26 January, 1880, in Little Rock, Arkansas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L Douglas 'Big Chief' MacArthur, born from a long family line of military men, graduated from West Point as an Engineer Corps second lieutenant in 1903 with the highest grade in the academy's history. In 1904, he was promoted to first lieutenant and travelled to the Philippines in order to help his father with the construction of their headquarters. Through his father's influence, MacArthur quickly became a military advisor to President Theodore Roosevelt until 1908, where he took command of an engineer company in Fort Leavenworth, reaching the rank of Captain in 1911. All these high profile postings allowed him to join the American General Staff in 1912, at the young age of 32. MacArthur took part in the occupation of Veracruz, learning Spanish in a matter of weeks and taking part in several small skirmishes with the rebels. He returned to America in 1919, when he was assigned as the Director of the United States' Military Academy at West Point. In 1922, he returned to the Philippines, this time to inspect the island's defence status, and having to intervene personally to end mutiny of Philippino scouts. With his promotion to Major General in 1925, his notoriety only grew and grew, being sent to the 1928 Olympic games in the Netherlands to head the American Olympic Committee. However, MacArthur was also forced to comply with orders he didn't agree with, like the court martial of Brigadier General Billy Mitchell, which MacArthur has called 'one of the most distasteful orders I ever received'. During the 'Bonus March', MacArthur was forced, under President Hoover's orders, to put down the 'Bonus Army' despite MacArthur's agreeing with the protestors' demands. He has since then become the highest ranking American Officer, although he has had a troubled relation with the government's executive branch.\n§YImportant Notes:§L- Born from a family that fought in the Civil War, MacArthur is willing to do whatever is necessary to keep America as a united, great and free country."
 USA_DWIGHT_EISENHOWER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L October 14, 1890, in Denison, Texas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L Dwight David 'Ike' Eisenhower, a fan of military history since a young age, applied for both West Point and Annapolis in 1910, being accepted in the former after the highest ranking candidate failed the physical requirement in 1911. He graduated in 1915 along with Omar Bradley and was almost discharged due to a leg injury, but West Point's chief medical officer interceded with the War Department and obtained a commission for him. Eisenhower would be posted with the 19th Infantry Regiment in the Mexican Border and reached the rank of Captain in 1917. He was transferred to Fort Benning in late 1918, where he remained training with the Camp Polk Tank school until the 1919 Motor Transport Corps convoy. 'Ike' was promoted to Major in 1920. His interest in armoured warfare only grew and grew, and quickly joined Patton's and Van Voorhis in their requests of increased funding for a mechanisation program. In 1924, he was sent to Panama, where he served under General Fox Conner, who decided to tutor 'Ike' into philosophy, military history and military theory and was selected in 1925 for the Command and General Staff College, graduating first in a class of 245 officers. Conner would help 'Ike' to get into the War College, becoming one of the youngest students of the academy and receiving the praise of General Pershing himself. After his graduation, he was assigned to the Army War College, and then served as executive officer to Major General George Van Horn Moseley, Assistant Secretary of War, from 1929 to 1933. Since then he has served as chief military aide of General Douglas MacArthur, accompanying him to the Philippines, where he served as assistant military adviser to the Philippine government. Since then, he has become MacArthur's undisputed second in command, and while their personalities tend to clash often, many claim that their skills complement each other."
 USA_OMAR_BRADLEY_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L February 12, 1893, in Clark, Missouri, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L Omar Nelson 'Brad' Bradley signed up to join the United States Military Academy in 1911, where he finished second in the placements for the appointments. However, the winner couldn't accept the congressional appointment for the academy, so it was granted to Bradley. He graduated in 1915 and was commissioned as an infantry second lieutenant, and becoming a close friend of another graduate of the same class, Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was assigned to the 14th Infantry Regiment stationed in the Mexican border, reaching the rank of Captain in 1917 and being transferred to guard the copper mines in Butte, Montana, remaining in garrison duties for the rest of the decade. From 1920 to 1924, he worked as a math teacher in West Point, reaching the rank of Major in 1924 and undergoing the advanced infantry course at Fort Benning. Bradley later studied at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School, graduating in 1929 and serving as an instructor in tactics at the U.S. Army Infantry School, where he met and established good relations with Lt.Col. George Marshall. He taught in West Point from 1929 to 1934, where he took a break to study at the U.S. Army War College, reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel. With the fears that the War Plan White might be executed in the near future, Bradley was promoted to Brigadier General along with Eisenhower by MacArthur's own request.\n§YImportant Notes:§L- Largely considered one of the most dependable generals of the US Army, Marshall once described him as 'A quiet, unassuming and capable man, with sound common sense. He has an absolute dependability. Give him a job and forget it' and that reputation may have helped to speed up his promotion."
 USA_GEORGE_MARSHALL_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L December 21, 1880, in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L George Catlett Marshall Jr. began his military career in the Virginia Military Institute in 1900, graduating in 1902 as a second lieutenant of the United States Army. Marshall was posted in the Philippines during the Philippine-American war, as well as helping to contain guerrilla operations in the area post-war. During the Weltkrieg, Marshall was sent to France, along with many other American officers as observers, where he was promoted to Captain for his observations. After working as aide-de-camp of General Pershing for a short time in 1919, he began being assigned to several positions in the army, mainly to relay his experience in the Weltkrieg to more inexperienced officers as well as helping the army modernise its doctrine. During this time, he became a key planner and writer in the War Department, commanded the 15th Regiment in the Legation Cities and taught the at the Army War College until 1927. Having being promoted to lieutenant colonel, he was appointed as assistant commandant of the Infantry School at Fort Benning, where he appointed Edwin F. Harding in charge of the school's publication. He'd be posted on different Infantry regiments until being promoted to colonel in 1933 and was promoted to his current rank of Brigadier General in late 1935 due to fear of desertion of several important members of the officer corps in case of 'internal instability'. Regardless, he is widely considered one of the best planners of the United States Army and is widely respected within the General Staff.\n§YImportant Notes:§L- Born from a Democrat father and a Republican mother, Marshall has become a politically tolerant man, both publicly and privately."
 USA_HENRY_H_ARNOLD_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L June 25, 1886, in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L Henry Harley "Hap" Arnold, a member of the distinguished American Arnold dynasty from which several politicians and military officers were part of, signed up for West Point when he had just turned 17. While he wanted to join the Cavalry corps, his grades and overall performance in the academy caused him to be assigned to the 29th Infantry Regiment, stationed at the Philippines. In April 1911, he requested a transfer to the Signal Corps, where he completed his instruction as an aviator on May. He'd continue his pioneering work in the air force throughout the late 1910s, and became fascinated by the aircraft developments in the Weltkrieg. During the Twenties, he joined up his colleague William Lendrum Mitchell to fight for an independent air force, which lead to Mitchell being court-martialled. Arnold stood, along with other renowned airmen, in defence of Mitchell but failed to win the trial. Arnold would continue to fight for an independent air force, trying to sway congressmen and recruit pilots to his cause, until he was sent to Fort Riley for 'attempting to influence legislation in an improper manner', where he spent the next few years writing books trying to interest young people in the air force. He'd return in 1928 to enter the Army's Command and General Staff School, from where he graduated in 1929. He'd continue changing posts in the American army until 1935, where he was assigned with the General Headquarters Air Force, the closest thing to an independent Air Force he had been in all his career, being promoted to Brigadier General in March 2, 1935. With his requests of an independent air force largely refused, Arnold may harbour some resentment against the general staff..."

Instead, he enlisted as a private for the Army, serving in the 18th Infantry Regiment for nearly seven years and reaching the rank of Sergeant by 1916. He took part in the Pancho Villa Expedition, performing remarkably and earning the rank of Second Lieutenant, after which he was sent to the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth.

Thanks to his studies in Minnesota, he managed to be appointed to the overseeing boards which developed new weapons for firearm companies, managing to reach the rank of First Lieutenant in 1909. He continued gaining relevance in the army thanks to his great leadership skills and technical expertise, reaching the rank of Captain in 1914 and taking part both in the Veracruz Expedition and the Pancho Villa Expedition with the 4th Field Artillery Regiment. He reached the rank of Major in 1917 and continued to take part in overseeing boards, experimenting with different types of artillery pieces as the Army began to prepare for possible involvement in the Weltkrieg that never came.\nHe was later assigned to the Army's Hawaiian department where he helped test new methods in coastal defence as well as spearheading the review of War Plan Orange, in the case of a Japanese attack of Hawaii. However, his involvement in what came to be known as the 'McNair Board' ended up drawing controversy from the Air Service Branch of the Army, which would later result in McNair presenting testimony against Billy Mitchell during a 1925 trial. He reached the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in 1928 and entered the War College, graduating two years later and serving as a teacher in the U.S. Army Field Artillery School and as commander of the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1934.

Warren. However, he did poorly and was dismissed from the academy in just one semester. His mother managed to convince the Senator to appoint him again the next year, but he dropped out, and while the Senator tried to appoint him for a third time the following year, he was rejected by the academy itself. Instead, Fredendall attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and undeterred by his experience in West Point, he took the officer's qualifying exam in 1906, achieving the highest grade of all the applicants. On February 13, 1907, he was finally commissioned as an infantry second lieutenant. Lloyd would then spend the rest of the decade working in several of the army's overseas schools, where he built a reputation of being an excellent teacher, trainer and administrator of troops. Like many other officers, he filled a series of staff and garrison duties in the United States during the twenties. He became both an instructor and student at the U.S. Army Infantry School, graduating in 1923 with distinction from the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School and graduating from the U.S. Army War College. During the early thirties, he was posted at the Statistics Branch of Washington, as the Inspector General's Department and later as Executive officer of the Office of the Chief of Infantry. During these staff duties, he met and has held close relations with both George Marshall and Leslie McNair, both of which nominated Fredendall for the rank of Brigadier General, a request that was granted by MacArthur in late 1935.

He was then posted to the Infantry School at Fort Benning, where he began teaching the basics of German Squad tactics to the eager staff, being promoted to major for his work. He'd continue perfecting his abilities, assisting the Army War College and graduating in 1922, and then leaving once more Germany, where he tried to foster good relations between the two countries' general staffs, but failing due to the hostile political climate of Germany towards the US. Krueger would then be assigned to the War Plans Division of the War Department General Staff, being one of the main engineers of the War Plan White, a hypothetical plan in case of another civil within the US. He was promoted to colonel in 1932, and later to Brigadier General for his new involvement in the War Plans Division."

After serving in several garrison posts, Lee was promoted to first lieutenant in 1912 and became an instructor for the Ohio National Guard. He'd choose to be sent to the Mexican border in late 1912 due to concerns that the Mexican Revolution might spill into American Borders. He conducted a series of topographical surveys in the American Pacific possessions, specifically Guam and Luzon in the Philippines, for which he was promoted to Captain in 1916. He was promoted to Major in 1920 and became Assistant Chief of Staff of the new Chicago-based VI Corps Area. He was posted as the District Engineer of Vicksburg, Mississippi when the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 happened, with Lee directing relief work and evacuations of towns and districts. After the passing of the Flood Control Act of 1928, Lee supervised works on the Red River, Ouachita River and Yazoo River and personally directed the construction of a new HQ and of the Waterways Experiment Station. After that, Lee attended the Army War College from September 1931 to June 1932 and became Assistant Commandant of the Army Industrial College, reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1934. Since then he has been the District Engineer of the Washington District and with the recent promotions, Lee earned his rank of Brigadier General, where his engineering skills may become vital for the staff."

Despite all setbacks, he graduated as a cavalry second lieutenant in 1909 and was assigned with the 15th Cavalry Regiment. In 1912, his athletic skills made him the army's choice to represent the United States for the first modern Pentathlon in the Stockholm Olympic games, ranking fifth out of forty two participants. With the launching of the punitive expedition, Patton became Pershing's Aide-de-Camp during the largely unsuccessful expedition, but this strengthened ties between them and Patton became an almost permanent member of his staff and was promoted to Captain soon enough. He was promoted to Major in June 31, 1920 and began taking an interest in the Weltkrieg’s use of mechanised warfare. In 1923 he'd graduate from the Cavalry's Field Officer's Course, from the Command and General Staff College in 1924 and the Army War College in 1932. During the protests of the Bonus Army, Patton had a major falling out with MacArthur, after which Patton has vocally opposed his colleague constantly.
