 improved_decryption_desc:0 "The development of more sophisticated computers allows for new applications of cryptanalysis methods like differencing, which can be used to break advanced ciphers when combined with new hand code-breaking methods."
 rocket_interceptor_2_desc:0 "Still considered extremely dangerous to operate, the rocket-powered fighters are now aided by auto-pilots and towing by other aircraft to maximise the use of their extreme speed but short fuel window."
 artillery1_desc:0 "With more modern materials and mechanisms, howitzers and field guns from the Weltkrieg can be re-chambered and modernised for modern warfare."
 mountain_gun_desc:0 "The mountainous terrain of Northern India led to the development of an artillery piece that could be dismantled and carried on mule back to wherever it was needed."
 rocket_artillery2_desc:0 "Self-propelled artillery utilising multiple rockets will be able to cause large-scale destruction rapidly, while maintaining mobility to avoid counter-fire."
