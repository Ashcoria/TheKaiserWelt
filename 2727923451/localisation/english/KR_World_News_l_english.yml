In this timeline, Theodore Roosevelt and his Bull Moose Party win the 1912 American presidential elections, leading to an American entry in the Weltkrieg and an Entente victory. A defeated and partially occupied Germany is gripped by constant economic and political crises, witnesses the defeat of the Whites in the Russian Civil War, and is couped by a bitter and extremely nationalist Adam Dressler. He leads the German Workers Party who follow the ideology of \"People's Socialism\", an extreme version of National Populism.\n\nThe novel ends with the beginning of a three-sided war between Dressler's \"New Reich\", the Western Entente led by the dominant British Empire, and a Soviet Russia led by Sergey Kirov. The book has divided critics, with some praising its attention to detail, while others criticise it for large flaws in historical logic.

Syndicalists have vowed to fight back against the dictatorship, but for now it appears Metaxas is in full control."

After marching on the Presidential house, they proceded to take over the Congress, where Severino has now been sworn is a Chairman, and the rivaling unions of the USA have been removed from the Congress.
