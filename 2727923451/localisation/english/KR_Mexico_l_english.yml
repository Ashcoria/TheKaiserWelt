### Leaders ###
 POLITICS_EMILIANO_ZAPATA_DESC:0 "Emiliano Zapata, hero of the Mexican Revolution, achieved victory in Mexico's 1932 Presidential election. Since taking office, he has promoted the development of Mexico's collective farms, 'Ejidos', and through political compromise, fostered closer diplomatic ties with the Commune of France. Zapata, however, faces strong opposition from other socialist factions, as well as remnants of the old regime."
 POLITICS_PLUTARCO_CALLES_DESC:0 "General Plutarco Calles has seized control of the Mexican government. While the totalitarian and rabidly anti-clerical tone of Calles's rhetoric are typical of Mexican socialist politicians, his rejection of agrarianism and support for full integration of indigenous Mexicans could represent a radical new direction for Mexico if implemented."
 POLITICS_PANCHO_VILLA_DESC:0 "Francisco 'Pancho' Villa's military victories against the armies of dictator Victoriano Huerta, such critical steps on the path to socialist revolution in Mexico, remain legendary in Mexico and abroad. Villa, while often at odds with Zapata, is similarly an agrarian socialist."
 POLITICS_PABLO_GONZALEZ_GARZA_DESC:0 "General Pablo Gonzalez Garza was once a steadfast ally of former president Carranza. With the death of Carranza and the ascent of Alvaro Obregón to the Mexican presidency, he went into hiding, waiting for the opportune moment to cleanse his beloved Mexico of socialist corruption; with the success of a military coup in Mexico, he is poised to do just that."
 POLITICS_JOSE_URQUIZA_DESC:0 "Jose Antonia Urquiza, fervent catholic and anti-socialist, has outmanoeuvred his ostensible allies within the Mexican military to assume control of the presidency. President Urquiza is as certain to promote faith in his Sinarquist regime as faith in God Himself."
 POLITICS_VINCENTE_TOLEDANO_DESC:0 "Vicente Toledano, personal aide and confidant of former president, Zapata, has now become president in his own right. He advocates a synthesis between European style syndicalism and Mexican agrarianism, whereby the state supports the industrialisation and unionisation of the collectivised farms, 'Ejidos'."
 POLITICS_LAZARO_CARDENAS_DESC:0 "Lazaro Cardenas of the moderate Partido Revolucionario Institucional has achieved victory in Mexico's presidential election. His platform is of reconciliation with Zapatistas and the Catholic Church alike."
 POLITICS_DONA_ITURBIDE_DESC:0 "Doña María Josephia Sophia de Habsburgo-Itúrbide has been crowned Empress of the new Mexican Monarchy. She traces descent from both Mexico's final indigenous Emperor and the adopted son of Maximillian. As an Austrian, her ascension to the throne has fostered closer ties between Austria and Mexico."
 POLITICS_DON_FERNANDO:0 "Don Fernando de Tultengo has been crowned King of Mexico. His legitimacy is based upon descent from the final Aztec Tlatoani, Moctezuma, and thus he lacks the dynastic links which could entangle the fate of Mexico with that of another."

### Ideas ###
 MEX_new_economic_policy_idea:0 "Nueva Política Económica"
 MEX_revolution_economic:0 "Economic Legacy of the Revolution"
 MEX_revolution_economic_desc:0 "The Mexican Revolution devastated the economy of Mexico. Since the end of the revolution we have been able to slowly climb out of that depression hole but we still have a ways to go before the economy can truly have recovered from the revolution."
 MEX_revolution_military:0 "Military Legacy of the Revolution"
 MEX_revolution_military_desc:0 "The military of Mexico had been transformed by the Mexican Revolution. Much of the army still is based on the military structure that existed during the revolution and notably the Constitutional Army and the Liberation Army of the South. Because of that legacy the Military is torn in two directions. The officers who served in the constitutional army wish to make sure that the Mexican Army is a professional army similar to the armies of Europe. While the officers that served in the Liberation Army of the South believe that a focus on a guerrilla warfare is the path for Mexico."

 MEX_new_economic_policy:0 "Nueva Política Económica"

 MEX_peoples_factories:0 "People's Factories"
 MEX_peoples_factories_desc:0 "We've had a mixed economy in our country since the Revolution, allowing private ownership of factories but enforcing several regulation and workers’ rights to industrialists. However, Calles sees this as a corruption of our revolution, and has ordered us to begin a collectivisation process for the industry, in order to truly allow the people to own the fruits of their labour."
 MEX_peoples_mines:0 "People's Mines"
 MEX_peoples_mines_desc:0 "Like it happened with our industry, our mines were also mostly in the hands of private investors. These foreign capitalists shall profit from the exploitation of our workers no further, as we shall collectivise the mining operations in our country."
 MEX_control_ejidos:0 "Control the Ejidos"
 MEX_control_ejidos_desc:0 "The Ejidos are by definition already a collectivised system of agricultural management, and we're very pleased with that.

 MEX_term_limits_rewrite:0 "Strengthen the Presidency"
 MEX_term_limits_rewrite_desc:0 "The Presidency in Mexico is not much different than Presidencies in other democracies.

To that end, he has proposed a reform that allows the President have its executive powers extended."
 MEX_loyal_military:0 "Loyal Military"
 MEX_loyal_military_desc:0 "The reason for our success during the revolution was the disloyalty of military elements that switched sides to our cause.

 MEX_direccion_federal_de_seguridad:0 "Dirección Federal de Seguridad"
 MEX_direccion_federal_de_seguridad_desc:0 "While we now enjoy the newfound loyalty of our armed forces, we need to create as well something to keep the civilian population and the military in check, just in case they change their minds and decide to overthrow us.

 MEX_lead_the_pnr:0 "Lead the PNR"
 MEX_lead_the_pnr_desc:0 "The 'Partido Nacional Revolucionario' is the party which currently supports Calles.

 MEX_political_commisars:0 "Political Officers"

 MEX_infrastructure_act:0 "Infrastructure Act"
 MEX_infrastructure_act_desc:0 "Mexico has a very rough terrain which has made private efforts to improve the national infrastructure unprofitable for their interests.

 MEX_federalism_desc:0 "Mexico has, for some time now, being a federal nation, with many states.

 MEX_mexican_synidcalism:0 "Mexican Syndicalism"
 MEX_mexican_synidcalism_desc:0 "While Syndicalism seems like a well-rounded system, it was designed in theory with Western European countries in mind, and it falls short in practice in certain aspects when considering countries outside that continent.

 MEX_mexican_socialism:0 "Mexican Socialism"
 MEX_mexican_socialism_desc:0 "Mexican society is complex. There are plenty of both conservative and progressive towns and citizens that, while wishing to help one another, fear each other.

### Events - start up ###

 mexico.1.t:0 "Mexico - A few years ago"
 mexico.1.d:0 "Mexico has been transformed in the recent years. In 1910 the Mexican Revolution began against Porfirio Díaz and would last nearly a decade. By 1917 Venustiano Carranza had become the president, however, he quickly proved to anger other revolutionaries when he embarked on a campaign to destroy his political rivals including Zapata. This would lead to the Plan de Agua Prieta by a number of military and political leaders and lead to Álvaro Obregón to becoming the President of Mexico. From here the chaos of the revolution would wind down as the government of Mexico began a period of stabilisation.\n\nThe first term of Álvaro Obregón would see improved relations with the United States, especially after Pancho Villa was made Ambassador to the Commune of France and Adolfo de la Huerta was able to finally get the Yankees to recognise the current government of Mexico as the legitimate government of Mexico. The economy would start to be improved especially in the south where Zapata held power and was able to implement the land reforms more comprehensively than they were being implemented elsewhere in the country. Obregón would work to improve labour rights though this would spark a new conflict between the two big unions - Confederación Regional Obrera Mexicana or CROM and the more syndicalist Confederación General de Trabajadores or CGT. However, all was not well in Mexico there was the growing tension from the Catholic population due to the draconian anti-clerical laws that were written into the Constitution against the Catholic Church."
 mexico.1.a:0 "And then?"

 mexico.300.t:0 "Mexico in 1936"
 mexico.300.d:0 "Obregón would be succeeded by Adolfo de la Huerta who would continue for the most part the same general policies. However, his term would have a number of international incidents for him to deal with. Notably the British Revolution and the subsequent Great Depression in the United States which would send shock-waves down southward and effect the economy of Mexico. This would all trigger conflicts in Central America, notably in Nicaragua, where Zapata would go and help spread his brand of revolutionary ideals southward. However, none of this was the most controversial thing de la Huerta did. That would be the rewriting of the term limits, so that Obregón could run for a second term, which of course Obregón won.\n\nHowever in 1932, Zapata would be elected on a Socialist and populist platform. Zapata's term would focus on the economy, particularly the agrarian sector with improvements on the working conditions and rights of peasants of the ejidos, or communal land under usufructuary property. Work to improve the rights of the peasants and natives within Mexico would be his main focus during his first term. However, his policies would anger the conservatives and Catholics even more. A more unpopular measure with the conservatives was the change to electoral law, restricting maximum terms to 1 but lengthening the duration of each term to 5 years. His overtures to the International would cause tension with the US as was his policy of land redistribution.\n\nAs 1936 dawns many wonder what form the future of Mexico will take."

 mexico.61.t:0 "The New Constitution"
 mexico.61.d:0 "In Mexico City today a new constitution was unveiled today. The Constitution of [GetYear] is rather similar to the 1917 Constitution, though it is also different in a number of ways. Notably it does not contain the same anti-clericalism, land reform and other radical parts that made up the 1917 constitution. It is regarded as a more moderate, more democratic constitution. While there is great fanfare in Mexico City, in a number of rural towns the new constitution was met with obvious disdain."
 mexico.61.a:0 "A new day rises in Mexico."

 mexico.62.t:0 "The Legacy of the Revolution"
 mexico.62.d:0 "The legacy of the Mexican Revolution has been something that has been up for debate within the Mexican Congress. Some regard the whole revolution as terrible and we should condemn it as a backwards step. Others wish though that we should condemn just the radicals like Zapata and Villa for destroying Mexico. What shall be decided?"
 mexico.62.a:0 "Condemn just Zapata and other Radicals."
 mexico.62.b:0 "Condemn the whole revolution."

 mexico.63.t:0 "Anti-Native Law"
 mexico.63.d:0 "A law has been proposed that would repeal the various laws that Zapata passed for the indigenous Mexicans. The law has a great deal of support from those in power among the right wing that regard the laws as just another policy that Zapata did to destroy Mexico. However, this naturally will not please the various indigenous Mexicans, notably the Maya and their allies in the Yucatan."
 mexico.63.a:0 "Pass the law."
 mexico.63.b:0 "Don't pass the law."

 mexico.64.t:0 "The Yucatan Rebellion"
 mexico.64.d:0 "As we consolidate power and repeal the laws that Zapata the people of the Yucatan Peninsula has decided to declare independence. The states of Yucatan, Campeche and Quintana Roo have all voted to join this treasonous Yucatan Republic."

 mexico.64.b:0 "Libertad o Muerte(play as Yucatan)"

 mexico.65.t:0 "Mexico is unable to pacify the Yucatan"
 mexico.65.d:0 "While [MEX.GetLeader] promised to defeat the Rebellious Yucatan in less than year, it is clear by now that is no longer the case. The fact that our armies have been driven back and ceasefire is in place, means that [MEX.GetLeader] must watch his back as various rivals might very well move to replace him."
 mexico.65.a:0 "We must watch our backs."

 mexico.66.t:0 "Yucatan manages to survive"
 mexico.66.d:0 "We have managed to drive out the Mexicans and for the first time, we are now a free and independent republic. Now that the war is over, we can focus on rebuilding the country, of course we must never let our guard down against the Mexicans that we will seek to take our land."

 mexico.68.t:0 "Rejoin Mexico?"
 mexico.68.d:0 "The right wing forces which took over in a coup within Mexico have been destroyed and they are restoring the various laws Zapata put in place, including his various laws to protect the indigenous communities of Mexico. The question is shall we end our rebellion and rejoin Mexico or fight onwards for independence once and for all?"
 mexico.68.a:0 "Let us Rejoin Mexico. (Game Over)"
 mexico.68.b:0 "Let us continue the fight for Independence!"

 mexico.69.t:0 "The Yucatan ends their rebellion"
 mexico.69.d:0 "The rebellion in the Yucatan has ended thanks to [MEX.GetLeader]'s policy of restoring the laws that Zapata passed. These laws plus assurances that their autonomy and traditions shall be respected and that the traitors that started this conflict would be punished harshly have helped to convince the Yucatec to rejoin the country."
 mexico.69.a:0 "Viva Mexico."

 mexico.70.t:0 "The Yucatan Fights on"
 mexico.70.d:0 "The Yucatec have decided that they rather fight on for independence despite our efforts to restore the laws of Zapata and punish the traitors. Very well, the Yucatan shall be pacified soon enough."

 mexico.84.a:0 "At last it is finished."

### National Populist events ###

 mexico.100.t:0 "Patria vs La Raza"
 mexico.100.d:0 "Synarchism as an ideology is still in its infancy, with the main unifying factor being a resistance to liberalism and secularism. Under the Synarchist banner there exist both Legionarists following the pattern of the Iron Guard, and the other followers of La Raza. The inherent conflict between these forces concerns their racial policies. The Synarchist leadership under Salvador Abascal sees the traditional caste system of Mexico as the correct social order, including the enshrinement of Catholic priests. La Raza as promoted by José Vasconcelos proports the idea of a Hispanic race as the true ideal of Mexican patriotism. These ideas are more similar to Integralism in Brazil than Legionarism. The party has begun to split with La Raza members becoming disillusioned with the lack of support they receive within the party. How can we correct this?"
 mexico.100.a:0 "We must appease these dissidents."

 mexico.105.d:0 "The Alamo a symbol of the defeat of Santa Anna and the disgrace he brought to Mexico when he lost the state of Tejas. It should be torn down so that this shame is permanently forgotten and as a punishment for the 'Texans' all those decades ago."
 mexico.105.a:0 "No longer shall they remember the Alamo."

 mexico.106.t:0 "Juventudes Sinarquistas"
 mexico.106.d:0 "The Juventudes Sinarquistas is a youth program that has been created by [MEX.GetLeader]. The organisation is to help train the youth the ideals of Sinarchismo and traditional catholic values. Structurally the organisation is similar to scouting groups that exist in other countries though controlled by the Mexican government. The Juventudes Sinarquistas has two main sub-organisations, one for boys and one for girls. By making sure that the youth are enrolled in the organisation this will make sure that they never sway from the government's ideals."
 mexico.106.a:0 "The youth are the future."

 mexico.107.t:0 "Plan for Central America"
 mexico.107.d:0 "When Mexico first broke off from Spain, Central America was part of the territories that were part of Mexico. Though they would later split off from Mexico, some within the government are wondering if the reconquista should also head southward and take the central American States. Others think that what we should do is form an alliance with the central American states as a few align with synarchismo thinking."
 mexico.107.a:0 "Reconquista Goes southward."
 mexico.107.b:0 "Allies to the South."

##Army Generals##

 ARMY_MEX_EMILIANO_ZAPATA_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L August 8, in Anenecuilco, Morelos, Mexico\n§YMilitary Career:§L Emiliano Zapata Salazar's military career began shortly after his political activism began, when he was forcefully conscripted into the 9th Cavalry regiment under Alfonso Pradillo in 1908, where he began experiencing the benefits and drawbacks of military life. With the Plan de San Luis going into effect and the death of Pablo Torres Burgos, Emiliano was chosen by the Southern Revolutionary Junta as the new revolutionary chief of the Southern Maderista Army. His first course of action was to take Cuautla from Porfirista forces, which was successful despite suffering heavy casualties. In order to increase recruitment, he promised every soldier who signed up with him a piece of arable land for themselves in exchange for their help in the revolution, and this tactic proved to be extremely successful with the disenfranchised peasants of the Mexican countryside."
 ARMY_MEX_PANCHO_VILLA_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L June 5, 1878, in San Juan del Rio, Durango, Mexico\n§YMilitary Career:§L José Doroteo Arango Arámbula, better known by his pseudonym, Francisco Villa or his nickname 'Pancho Villa', has become a living legend for the people of Mexico. He started his adventure when Laureano Lopez Negrete, the owner of the Sombretillo Ranch where Doroteo worked, abused his older sister. In reprisal, he shot Laureano, and then evaded capture from the authorities, after which he escaped to the nearby mountains, where he was found by a gang of bandits lead by a man called Francisco Villa. He'd accompany the bandits for years, raiding and pillaging around Durango until Francisco Villa was shot in a firefight, and named Doroteo his successor to lead the gang. Doroteo then adopted the name of his saviour, and continued his criminal activity. With the leadership of the gang secured, Villa decided to join forces with Ignacio Parra, and started his attempts to stop, sometimes violently, the abuses committed by the landlords to the peasants in Chihuahua. In the late 1910 he'd join the Movimiento Maderista, and through cunning and bravery, 'Pancho Villa' reached the higher ranks of the Mexican Revolutionary Army with the nickname 'The Centaur of the North', and even managed to shortly become Governor of Chihuahua. He'd anger the American government in 1916 after attacking the small town of Columbus in New Mexico, which lead to the Punitive Expedition led by John Pershing, who was never able to catch Villa despite all his efforts. Villa has since then played a major role in the Revolutionary army and Mexico's politics. He is a respected member of the General staff, although he's been seen lately dabbling more on politics than learning military strategy.\n§YImportant Notes:§L- Member and one of the main candidates of the Partido Nacional Agrarista."
 ARMY_MEX_PLUTARCO_CALLES_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L September 25, 1877, in Guaynas, Sonora, Mexico\n§YMilitary Career:§L Francisco Plutarco Elías Campuzano, born in an accommodated landlord family, graduated as a teacher in 1894 and dedicated to his teaching profession in Hermosillo and Guaynas, while trying to administrate the family business. When he moved to Agua Prieta, Governor José María Maytorena named him deputy. After the Decena Trágica, Calles began recruiting men from Agua Prieta to oppose Victoriano Huerta and in 1913 would join up the revolutionary forces to fight. Calles ended up under the direct orders of Alvaró Obregon, and became colonel and commander of Hermosillo by late 1913. In October of 1914, Calles successfully defended the city of Naco for three months, managing to hold against all odds, and due to this he was turned into Brigadier General by February 1915. With the success of the Plan de Agua Prieta and Obregon's rise to power, Calles became his second in command, and would become a vital member of the staff for years to come, although he has been seen dabbling more into politics in the recent years.\n§YImportant Notes:§L- Member and one of the main candidates of the Partido Nacional Revolucionario.\n-He has a very strict moral standard, and he sees both alcohol and religion as dangerous for the mind of both his soldiers and his people."
 ARMY_MEX_JUAN_G_CABRAL_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L April 3, 1883, in Minas Prietas, Sonora, Mexico\n§YMilitary Career:§L Juan German Cabral worked as miner before reaching his twenties, where he moved to Cananea, taking part of the 1906 general strike, where he met his future contacts for the Mexican Revolution. He was one of the first revolutionaries to take up arms against Porfirio Diaz and took part in several of the early battles of the revolution. In May 1911, he took Cananea and Naco, and due to this he was ascended to Cavalry Colonel by Francisco Madero himself. He would become Commander in February 1912, and in 1913 he'd join Victoriano Huerta's forces. He'd be then selected to carry out low risk operations and was generally chosen as military governor by Obregón as a more conciliatory man than his colleagues like Maytorena and Callés. He has since then taken part in several diplomatic missions to other South American countries, and remains a very respected member of the staff, even being known as 'The cleanest military man from the revolution'\n§YImportant Notes:§L- Apathetic to Politics."
 ARMY_MEX_PABLO_QUIROGA_ESCAMILLA_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L June 7, 1875, in Cienaga de Flores, Nuevo León, Mexico\n§YMilitary Career:§L Pablo Quiroga Escamilla incorporated into the constitutionalist army in 1913, and was under the orders of Manuel M. Diéguez. With the Volunteer corp and the 13th Battalion of Lancers, Escamilla lead several expeditions in Sonora, Sinaloa, Nayarit and Jalisco. He assisted in the Battle of Santa Ros, the siege of Guaymas and fight for Oredáin. He was promoted to colonel in 1914, taking part in another series of operations in Silao y Trinidad, Guanajuato, Queretaro and Durango. In 1915 he was promoted to Brigadier General, and would take part in another 25 expeditions throughout the revolution and in the post-revolutionary era. While an experienced member of the general staff, he has been slowly but surely losing interest in his military career, and may be willing to resign soon enough."

He was initially under the command of Gertrudis G. Sanchéz, but would continually switch sides during the revolution until joining the Army of Operations under the command of Álvaro Obregón. He was commendated for bravery at the Battle of Celaya. In 1916, he fought in Morelos and in Mexico City against the Zapatist forces, executing several civilians under the fear that they were going to betray Obregon's troops. In 1918, he operated in Durango and Chihuahua against the Villistas, and in 1920 he joined the Plan de Agua Prieta, which catapulted him to the rank of Brigadier General. Since then he has been named Headmaster of military education at the Heroico Colegio Militar, and he has held his post since then, encouraging discipline and technical expertise over raw manpower, and propagated sports and cultural activities through popular libraries in the barracks.\n§YImportant Notes:§L- His relations with both Zapata and Villa are sour at best. Fighting against them in the revolution have made Joaquin very wary of his new colleagues."
 ARMY_MEX_FRANCISCO_LUIS_URQUIZO_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L June 21, 1891, in San Pedro de las Colinas, Coahuila, Mexico\n§YMilitary Career:§L Francisco Luis Urquizo Benavides joined the revolution in 1911 in Coahuila under the orders of Emilio Madero, where he'd later be assigned as one of Francisco Madero's personal guard, fighting alongside Madero in the Decena Tragica.
