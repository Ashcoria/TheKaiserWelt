 cend.1.d.GUA_socialist:0 "With the success of the socialist-Unity coalition, we have managed to escape the grasps of both Ubico and Orellana against all odds. This has managed to open up diplomacy with other like-minded revolutionary nations, the most recent example being [From.GetNameDefCap]. They hope to build ties with us and others to free the rest of Central America from what we also suffered from. Hopefully this can mean closer cooperation between our nations into the future."
 cend.1.d.GUA_liberal:0 "Since we have achieved greater democracy, our liberal friends from [From.GetNameDefCap] have approached us to establish closer ties. This is a grand gesture, one we cannot ignore. We must cooperate with our friends to further democracy in the rest of Central America."
 cend.1.d.GUA_military:0 "We have been approached by [From.GetNameDefCap]. They know our struggle and after we have successfully remained in power, they have now come to us with an offer of friendship. We cannot refuse this, as we are always threatened by revolution."

 cend.1.d.ELS_socialist:0 "With the success of Martí in the revolution against the corrupt military dictatorship, he has managed to gain full control over El Salvador and truly free the people. This has been noticed by the fellow revolutionary country of [From.GetNameDefCap], hoping to build ties with us to free the rest of Central America from what we also suffered from. Hopefully this can mean closer cooperation between our nations into the future."
 cend.1.d.ELS_liberal:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] have sent a delegation to establish closer ties, following our restoration of the presidency. This shows serious goodwill, something we must return in our stead. We will establish a lasting friendship together, to hopefully be able to strengthen democracy throughout Central America."
 cend.1.d.ELS_military:0 "Now that we have survived a second revolution, [From.GetNameDefCap] have come to us as friends. We must take this opportunity to develop closer ties, so we can stand united when we are once again threatened by the ever-looming scourge of revolution."

 cend.1.d.HON_socialist:0 "Despite many questioning the legitimacy of our socialism across Central America, it is universally agreed that we stand alongside the revolution with our Central American partners. As a result, [From.GetNameDefCap] has sent an embassy congratulating our new government for its success in its revolution, hoping for further collaboration down the line."
 cend.1.d.HON_liberal:0 "After successfully holding our first truly open elections, our democratic friends from [From.GetNameDefCap] have come to us to establish closer ties. This is a great proposition and we will together work on strengthening democracy in both our countries, and in the rest of Central America."
 cend.1.d.HON_military:0 "Now that we are firmly in power, [From.GetNameDefCap] have offered to develop closer ties. We must accept this, so we can work together to prevent revolution spreading throughout Central America. We do not want others falling, because when one has fallen, they will undoubtedly seek to topple the next."

 cend.1.d.NIC_socialist:0 "As we have managed to survive through the storm of American occupation and Central American crisis, we are a highly desired ally among revolutionaries within Central America. [From.GetNameDefCap] has recognised this, sending us an embassy to ensure further cooperation between our nations."
 cend.1.d.NIC_liberal:0 "Following our liberal transformation, [From.GetNameDefCap] has approached us to congratulate us on our achievement and with the offer of developing closer ties. We will of course accept this and establish a strong bond of friendship between fellow Central American nations, with the aim of strengthening democracy."
 cend.1.d.NIC_military:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] have come to us to develop better relations. We cannot refuse this as we are always at risk of being consumed by revolution, that is the nature of our regime. Developing closer ties with the countries like us will make sure that revolution will not spread throughout Central America."

 cend.1.a:0 "Socialist unity comes out strong."
 cend.1.b:0 "In times of trouble, we come together."
 cend.1.c:0 "Together, we stand against the revolution."

 cend.5.t:0 "Formation of the Revolutionary Front"
 cend.5.d.socialist:0 "The Revolutionary Front, founded by [From.GetNameDefCap] is meant to be a pact to organise the men of Central America against those who would oppress them. The liberals who have betrayed us so many times in the past, the military dictators who have hurt us, and the foreign oppressors who support them. It is time this shackle is thrown off once and for all!"

 cend.5.b:0 "A new threat emerges."
 cend.5.c:0 "A threat to our existence!"

 cend.6.t:0 "Formation of the Liberal Pact"
 cend.6.d.socialist:0 "A 'Liberal' Pact has been founded by [From.GetNameDefCap]! They claim that they will improve the lives of their countrymen, but in reality they just empower to the already rich and powerful, not unlike the military dictatorships they like to criticize. Furthermore, they claim that the Pact will be a bastion against socialist revolutionaries. We must prevent them from endangering our revolution!"
 cend.6.d.liberal:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has founded the Liberal Pact! it is designed to bring together the liberal countries of Central America to resist the evil growth of military dictatorships and socialist revolutionaries. Those who join it will defend each other and make sure that its members remain democratic."
 cend.6.d.military:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has founded the Liberal Pact! They aim to bring together what they call the liberal nations of Central America. They however are unable to see that they are just weak-minded and weak-spirited. We must prevent them from mustering a coalition to topple our regime."
 cend.6.a:0 "Those bunch are just as bad as the military."
 cend.6.b:0 "It's time for true democracy!"
 cend.6.c:0 "You can't beat military democracy!"

 cend.7.t:0 "Formation of the People's Vanguard"
 cend.7.d.socialist:0 "The crooked dictatorship of [From.GetNameDefCap] has formed the People's Vanguard. They seek to insulate themselves from revolution by working together with other dictatorships! We will not allow this. We must prevent their coalition from taking shape and we must work hard to prevent them from ending the revolution in Central America. If they get what they want, all our work may be for nothing!"
 cend.7.d.liberal:0 "Because robbing their own people of their freedom is not enough, [From.GetNameDefCap] has formed the People's Vanguard. It is aimed to protect themselves from any outside challenge to their rule. We know that such an illiberal pact will soon fail, but we must make sure they do not permanently smother the torch of liberty in the rest of Central America. We must do everything we can to prevent them from attacking our democracy!"
 cend.7.d.military:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has founded the People's Vanguard! Just like us, they prefer a stronger type of government and for that reason, there are many who are jealous and seek to topple our governments. They seek to end this by working together to defend Central America from the rising tide of revolution."
 cend.7.a:0 "Our biggest threat."
 cend.7.b:0 "They won't stand for long."
 cend.7.c:0 "Together, we may stand strong!"

 cend.8.d.socialist:0 "With the founding of the Revolutionary Front, it has attracted many to work together to free our brethren across the countries. The first to answer this call has been [From.GetNameDefCap], joining us in our struggle against oppression and lies."
 cend.8.d.liberal:0 "Our work has not been for nothing, as [From.GetNameDefCap] has joined the Liberal Pact! Together we will be stronger than alone and together we will be able to defend our shared values and our democracy. Together we can protect what is ours from the military dictators and socialist revolutionaries who wish to take it from us."
 cend.8.d.military:0 "Our friends in [From.GetNameDefCap] have joined the People's Vanguard. We no longer stand alone in our struggle to contain the revolution in Central America. We will work together with them to prevent any kind of spark from threatening the stability of our rule. Together, we will be even stronger as the liberals and socialists are isolated."
 cend.8.a:0 "Together for victory!"
 cend.8.b:0 "The torch of liberty stands strong."
 cend.8.c:0 "The status-quo will be retained."

 cend.9.d.socialist:0 "We have been petitioned to join the Revolutionary Front, the pact founded by [From.GetNameDefCap]! They have asked us to join them in their revolutionary struggle to help rally the men and women of Central America to truly liberate us all. They say that we can only resist our oppressors together. If we are united in this pact, we now we have to decide whether or not their struggle is also ours."

 CEN_petition_refuse_liberal:0 "Liberty belongs in one country, not many."

 cend.9.d.military:0 "We have been petitioned by [From.GetNameDefCap] to join the People's Vanguard. They state that in this violent era, no regime is safe and that only by working together to safeguard stability can we efficiently resist the rising tide of liberalism and socialism. They say that without cooperation, the countries of Central America will one by one fall to revolution. We must decide whether it is worth it to join their cause."
 CEN_petition_accept_military:0 "Cooperation is key in desperate times."
 CEN_petition_refuse_military:0 "We can stand on our own."

 cend.10.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Joins the [ROOT.GetFactionName]"
 cend.10.d.socialist:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] have agreed to join our pact. We now stand together with them in our revolutionary struggle to liberate Central America! Not only are our forces united and will we be better prepared to wage war on our enemies, but our spirits are united as well, something which will undoubtedly help advance the revolutionary mindset of our country! Hail to our new brothers and sisters!"
 cend.10.d.liberal:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has accepted our request to join the Liberal Pact. They have made an excellent decision, as together we can create a lasting impact on our corner of the world and safeguard democracy for generations to come! United, we will make sure that the torch of liberty will not be extinguished. We will protect them and they will protect us."
 cend.10.d.military:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has made a wise decision and have heeded our petition. By doing this, we will make sure that together we will fight against the liberals and socialists who seek to topple our rightfully installed regimes. We fight for the people, more than the revolutionaries ever will. With the help of [From.GetNameDefCap], we will keep the revolution at aby."
 cend.10.a:0 "Together for victory!"
 cend.10.b:0 "We'll come out on top."

 cend.11.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 cend.11.d.socialist:0 "The cowards of [From.GetNameDefCap] have denied our petition. Instead of joining our forces in order to empower the revolution, they have decided to deny us and go their own path, thus betraying our revolution. But our spirits are strong and even without the help of our fellow Central Americans, we can take a stand against our oppressors. We will not let their refusal to cooperate affect us."
 cend.11.d.liberal:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has refused our petition! This is unfortunate, as we cannot be sure that freedom will remain in their country.
