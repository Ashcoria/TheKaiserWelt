### Set Up Events ###
 amcivwar.1.t.president:0 "President Reed Escapes to Chicago"
 amcivwar.1.t.not_president:0 "Jack Reed Calls for Action"

 amcivwar.1.d.president:0 "President Reed has escaped to Chicago and declared that MacArthur is a traitor to all the people of America. His calls have gained a great deal of support in the Steel Belt, and a number of governors have already announced that they do not recognise the 'illegitimate' authority of the current government. They have closed off their borders to American soldiers, raising a chilling spectre of the civil war the country experienced less than a century ago."
 amcivwar.1.d.macarthur:0 "Jack Reed has given a rousing a radio broadcast from Chicago, urging all his followers to rise up against the twin tyrants of General MacArthur and Huey Long. Within the hour, a number of governors across the Steel Belt have announced their support and declared both Huey Long and General MacArthur as having no true authority. The governors have been bolstered by Reed's supporters, who within days have overtaken army posts and erected road blocks throughout the northern states."

 amcivwar.1.d.nothing_is_done:0 "The violence in Pittsburgh was just the spark that was needed for Jack Reed to declare on the radio that President Olson is a puppet of the corporations and a dishonest conman, intent on selling out the American worker to the highest bidder. He said it is time for the worker to make a stand. A number of northern governors immediately declared their support for Reed, backed up by syndicalist militias who have spread throughout the states to block roads and take over army bases."
 amcivwar.1.d.revolt_against_compromise:0 "The compromise attempt has failed and with its failure, America has been broken. Jack Reed today announced that the workers of America must take a stand against the governments, and almost immediately a number of northern governors declared their support for him. They say President Olson and his government have no authority, demanding they surrender to a committee headed by Reed to oversee the restructuring of the government 'as the founding fathers intended'."
 amcivwar.1.d.assassination_long:0 "With chaos engulfing the country following the failed assassination of Huey Long, Reed has seized the moment and denounced the federal government as puppets of their capitalist masters. A number of northern governors immediately declared their support for Reed, declaring the 'morally bankrupt' government as having no true authority. These state governments are backed up by syndicalist militias who have spread throughout the states to block roads and take over army bases."
 amcivwar.1.d.assassination_reed:0 "The assassination attempt against Jack Reed has been foiled, and worse, the involvement of the federal government has been made public. This is all the justification the SPA needed. Jack Reed today denounced President [USA.GetLeader] and Huey Long both as traitors and tyrants, and has rallied his supporters to defend their way of life against tyranny. A number of northern governors immediately declared their support for Reed, backed up by syndicalist militias who have spread throughout the states to block roads and take over army bases."

 amcivwar.1.d.long_assassinated:0 "With chaos engulfing the country following the assassination of Huey Long, Jack Reed has seized the moment and denounced the federal government as tyrants and American democracy as truly dead. A number of northern governors immediately declared their support for Reed, declaring the 'morally bankrupt' government as having no true authority. These state governments are backed up by syndicalist militias who have spread throughout the states to block roads and take over army bases."
 amcivwar.1.d.austerity:0 "With his supporters fired up by the federal government's collusion with Huey Long and the AFP, Jack Reed has seized the moment and called on American workers to rise up against a tyrannical system which has betrayed them. A number of northern governors immediately declared their support for Reed, declaring the 'morally bankrupt' government as having no true authority. These state governments are backed up by syndicalist militias who have spread throughout the states to block roads and take over army bases."

 amcivwar.1.d.default:0 "The crackdown on the Socialist Party could have only had one outcome: to protect the rights of workers across the nation, Jack Reed has called upon the workers of America to stand up against their capitalist overlords, saying that decent Americans have a moral obligation to take action against President Garner and the corruption he represents. A number of northern governors immediately declared their support for Reed, backed up by syndicalist militias who have spread throughout the states to block roads and take over army bases."

Both are tyrants that need to be toppled, and only the AFP, under his guidance, can cleanse America. He has gained ready listeners among a number of southern governors, all of whom have recognised that they recognise the authority of neither MacArthur nor President Reed."
 amcivwar.2.d.president_long:0 "President Huey Long has escaped to Baton Rouge and has declared that General MacArthur is a traitor to the people of America. He has gained ready listeners among a number of southern governors, all of whom have recognised that they no longer recognise MacArthur's authority, and demanded his resignation. Long has spoken on the radio, urging all Americans to support the legitimate President and fight against the tyranny MacArthur represents."

A number of southern governors have put their support behind him, announcing that they do not see the Olson government as legitimate and thus refuse to recognise its authority."
 amcivwar.2.d.revolt_against_compromise:0 "The compromise attempt has failed, and with its failure America has been broken. Huey Long declared on the radio today that the corrupt President Olson and the tyrannical Reed both must be stopped for the good of America, and has called for all decent Americans to rise up against them. A number of southern governors have put their support behind him, announcing that they do not see the Olson government as legitimate, and while they have not yet gone so far as to announce secession from the Union they have made it clear that they do not recognise the government's authority within their borders."

 amcivwar.2.d.assassination_reed:0 "With chaos engulfing the country following the failed assassination of Jack Reed, Huey Long has seized the moment and denounced the federal government as corrupt and beyond redemption. A number of southern governors have put their support behind him, announcing that they do not see the [USA.GetName] government as legitimate. While they have not yet gone so far as to announce secession from the Union they have made it clear that they do not recognise the government's authority within their borders."

These state governments are backed up by Minutemen militias who have spread throughout the states to block roads and take over army bases."

 amcivwar.2.d.default:0 "Huey Long has declared that President [USA.GetLeader] is a tyrant and must be opposed. In a radio speech, he denounced the president for being in league with the syndicalists of the SPA, and accused him of doing nothing to stop the chaos. Long has vowed to restore order and destroy the corrupt government in Washington, and a number of southern governors immediately declared their support for him and demanded that [USA.GetLeader] immediately step down and turn over control to Long and a 'reconciliation committee' that would see a restructuring of the American government."

They currently have not seceded from the Union, but instead refuse to recognise the authority of any of the competing governments.

 amcivwar.4.d.reed:0 "A tense standoff has erupted in the United States, as the elected President Reed fled to the city of Chicago after being forcibly removed from his position by General Douglas MacArthur. From Chicago, Reed's supporters have declared MacArthur's government illegitimate - as have the southern supporters of Huey Long, based in Baton Rouge, and the Pacific Governors under the leadership of Governor Frank Merriam. All have been given a deadline by General MacArthur of thirty days to either stand down or face arrest and execution. Considering all sides are rapidly raising forces, the idea that America seems headed into a second civil war seems almost certain."

 amcivwar.4.d.olson:0 "President Floyd Olson experienced a major blow today as a large number of governors declared his government illegitimate, throwing their support behind either populist Huey Long or the syndicalist leader Jack Reed. They have stopped short of seceding from the Union, but declared that the federal government holds no authority within their state borders until Olson steps down and a 'reconciliation council' is put in place to restore order. In response, President Olson has given the governors thirty days to stand down - making it all but certain that the United States will descend into civil war for the second time in less than a century."

They have stopped short of seceding from the Union, but have declared that the federal government holds no authority within their state borders until [USA.GetLeader] steps down.

Filmed on a modern sound stage, the daring rescue is portrayed by ex-Hollywood Paul Robeson. Although the real life William Crowley preferred the church choir, Paul Robeson's musical numbers were jaunty popular tunes. The film has proven to be a smashing success at the box office, beating out an adaptation of Jack London's The Iron Heel at the opening weekend. The press caught up to William Crawley, where he commented that the film is 'Quite the spectacle on our great liberation'."

 amcivwar.33.d:0 "As the war stalemates and perhaps may even turn against us, the Central Committee is debating a comprehensive economic reform proposal known as 'War Syndicalism.' Some of its proposals, such as state control of all foreign trade, nationalisation of all factories, strict labour discipline are not especially controversial. It also includes potentially problematic measures such as the outlawing of wildcat strikes, obligatory labour-duty for those not working or in the military, strict food rationing, and military control over railroads. This is seen as tyrannical within the SPA with a number saying that some of the latter measures, especially the outlawing of wildcat strikes would betray the values of the revolution, and make the current government no better than its Capitalist enemies. Those supporting the proposal in the Vanguard counter that it is necessary in order to achieve victory in the revolution, and that the first laws passed after the end of the war will revert War Syndicalism."

Derisively named the 'Red Witches' by the reactionary forces under Huey Long, the squadron, led by Florence 'Pancho' Barnes, has taken their new nickname up with a great deal of pride."

Now the AFL, as a part of the coalition fighting the socialist revolution, has begun to exercise their ideological autonomy. They have chosen to occupy the entire left side of the IWW, and begun to pull in allies. Their debates with the IWW can sometimes leak out into street brawls, and, in two cases, friendly fire. The Vanguards, owing only their allegiance to the revolution, have tried to foster cooperation.

However, many of our comrades, whether in the Steel Belt or elsewhere in America, have been lied to their entire lives by the capitalists, and do not understand how the revolution frees them. Many do not give their heart and soul to the revolution, and some even attempt to sabotage our efforts, unaware that we are the only force that truly cares for them. This must be remedied, and our comrades must be deprogrammed.

Some believe that by having these politicians work hard labour for a few years, they will empathise with the worker, and be converted to our cause.

Of the many proposals submitted to the Central Committee, one stands out. Earl Browder's proposal is to create a committee to enforce revolutionary order and stop counter-revolutionary sabotage.

Although not commonplace, reports of systematic mass executions and torture are being reported from both the front lines and core territories to suppress populations suspected of aiding the capitalist factions.

These men are inclined to close their factories and refineries within the South to comply with orders from the Federal Government. However, they are instead persuaded by Lindbergh to stick up for Huey Long and move their business empires into the American Union State on a few conditions. They ask that Huey Long guarantee some sort of political exception to them in these dire economic times as well as a promise of political office once the war is won. If Long agrees to their demand, it will give them greater influence and many of his supporters will wonder if he plans on betraying his ideals. However, refusing in such a time may prove costly."

Pelley is the leader of an all-white Legionarist political and religious social club called the Silver Legion. His membership size is moderate but his enthusiasm for Huey Long's ideals is unsettlingly enthusiastic. Pelley has come with a request for money to take on an evangelistic and patriotic tour of America to gather supporters for the American Union State. This proposal would imply to Huey's followers that he supports the fledgling Christian Identity movement, which clashes with his personal distaste for the political ideology of Klansmen and Prohibitionists.

In order to raise an army for the American Union State in favour of what they see as a moral war, they have officially combined their beliefs to form the Pelley-Armstrong line. This has swelled the Silver Legion into the tens of thousands of members from all across the country, and reports of their speeches have come in. In inclusion to the strongly anti-Catholic and pro-segregationist rhetoric at these speeches are promises that are said to come from Huey Long in favour of almost extraordinary wages for whites and benefits for veterans after the civil war.

A number of the northeastern governors in New England, their states beset by syndicalist militia violence, have formally asked the Canadian government to intervene. Clearly they feel the Federal government is incapable of the task, though some of our ministers feel this might be seen by some of the factions less as intervention and more as aggression. They say the matter should be debated in Parliament before any action is taken. For New England, at least, that might not be quick enough to save them."

The rest would be ceded to [survivor.GetNameDef]. Outside of that, there are no guarantees and no talk of actual peace... eventually there will be a reckoning.

Pacific forces would withdraw to new boundaries west of the agreed-upon border, while [survivor.GetAdjective] forces would withdraw eastward. This is not an official peace, however, and many feel that a future reckoning between the two countries - a final showdown, as it were, for the future destiny of America - is all but inevitable. Even so, this is a moment of respite for each side to gather their strength and count their dead, and Americans on both sides are celebrating a bit of peace snatched from the jaws of chaos."

### MacArthur's War ###

 amcivwar.700.d:0 "General MacArthur has long been preparing his plans for combatting civil unrest. The original War Plan White from the early '20s insisted on respecting the Constitution's provisions on states' rights. It said that only the governor could request federal troops to suppress a revolt. The situation in the nation now, unfortunately, requires stronger action. With President MacArthur's 30-day amnesty deadline yielding few results, it seems the United States needs to prepare for war. \n\nThere are three plans that have been proposed to the cabinet and chiefs of the military:\n\n1. War Plan White: Yorktown recommends abandoning the many military bases on the West Coast, in the Rockies, the Great Plains and the Midwest. With the withdrawal of Federal troops east of the Missisippi, the plan hopes the concentration of Federal troops on the eastern seaboard will be able to crush rebellions in Pennsylvania, the Carolinas, New England, and Georgia.\n\n2. War Plan White: San Jacinto calls for relocating the government to the Great Plains, along with much of the military, in order to crush resistance in the Pacific states. If properly executed, this would allow us to recapture the mutineering Pacific fleet. \n\n3. Lastly, MacArthur's original War Plan White, drafted late last year, calls for holding a corridor from Virginia to whichever states remain loyal in the Midwest. We hope that our superior organisation and mobility can quickly crush the rebellions before they can link up or begin war production. What should we choose?"

As such, there were few military bases or commands in the area, and few depots or bases to evacuate. In Nevada, unfortunately, Hawthorne Army Depot has refused orders to move materiel east. However, the states of New Mexico and Arizona were different. Here, Forts Yuma and Huachaca, built in the last century to protect against Indian raids and Mexican bandits, remained strong. Happily, they also remained loyal, and the soldiers and men there are trucking north and east as quickly as they can. The citizens of these states are cautiously obeying the instructions of the governors to remain where they are until a regional decision is made."

 amcivwar.702.t:0 "Evacuation of the Northern Great Plains"
 amcivwar.702.d:0 "Like the rest of the old West, the only military bases in the north of the Great Plains were established during the last Indian Wars to finally pacify the region. Fort Russel in Wyoming, Fort Missoula in Montana, and Camp Grafton in North Dakota are now fairly badly-equipped bases, having not fought a battle or skirmish since the 1880s. The lack of hostile civilian activity has made the evacuation relatively smooth, and the troops have withdrawn south to Colorado and Missouri."

 amcivwar.703.d:0 "The central Plains, Denver in particular, have become a rallying point for troops and militiamen in the Plains and west, coming together to organise, train, and fight the rebellions. As the President has decided to abandon the Plains until he can take Chicago and Baton Rouge, these troops have been sent out of Denver east to Missouri, to meet the loyalist militias already converging on St Louis. The governor of Colorado has begged our troops to stay and protect his state from the radical rebels, but they had their orders. The west has been left for dead."

He refused to allow our men to cross the Missisippi without checking each unit's papers by Washington by telegram. Our men seem to have gotten slightly fed up with this, and stormed across the bridge in Cairo to Kentucky. Unfortunately, the bridge could only take so many people, and the bridge soon collapsed, leaving thousands of men stranded on the far side. Ferries were soon organised to bring them over, but the first shots of opposition to the army were seen as the last of our men left St Louis as AFP militiamen shot at our retreating troops."

However, a recent regional conference of the four governors in Salt Lake City has led to them deciding to collectively rely on the provisional government in California for protection and support. Apparently, most of them were led to this by their clear abandonment by the Washington government. They have denounced MacArthur’s takeover pro forma and the Sacramento government has already sent in its own soldiers and airmen to occupy the abandoned bases in the west."

Unfortunately for MacArthur’s government, stripping New Mexico of defenders left it open to takeovers from nearby. Steaming up the Pecos and racing along the roads to Albuquerque and Santa Fe, Huey Long’s loyal Minutemen and National Guard captured the greater part of New Mexico before the police knew what was happening. Soon, Progressive governor Tingley surrendered the state via radio before fleeing west to the PSA, taking most of the administration of the state with him."

President Reed has been stymied in his assault west, and his newly formed command staff is reportedly considering southern and eastern strikes instead, to push their advantage against Huey Long."
 amcivwar.763.a:0 "Next up, Chicago!"
 amcivwar.763.b:0 "Bad news."

 amcivwar.764.t:0 "New England in Desperate Straits"
 amcivwar.764.d:0 "Although the Crown had previously refused the request of New Englander governors to ensure their neutrality, since the cabinet had deemed further endangerment of the military position of the Federal government unwise, the repeat of the request last night has brought about a different reaction. With the only alternative to British-Canadian intervention in the region being occupation by the forces of the Combined Syndicates, even cabinet and Privy Council Americophiles have warmed to the idea of intervening. Should the British-Canadian government act?"
 amcivwar.764.a:0 "We must remain neutral."
 amcivwar.764.b:0 "The people of New England need us, we must help them!"

 amcivwar.765.t:0 "Canada Seizes New England"
 amcivwar.765.d.CSA:0 "The push on D.C. seems to have given the British Empire to our north the idea that we were a threat. They have accepted the request for protection by the traitorous governors of New England. Our forces were unable to make any headway in the North-East before encountering Canadian troops. New Jersey, however, fell to our militia and Internationale allies in New York City before the Entente forces could reinforce it."
 amcivwar.765.d.others:0 "The socialist push on D.C. seems to have given the British Empire to our north the idea that they were a real threat. They have accepted the request for protection by the governors of New England, and they are now eyeing the socialists over the border. CSA forces were unable to make any headway before encountering Canadian troops. The state of New Jersey, however, has fallen to their militia and Internationale allies in New York City before we could reinforce it."
 amcivwar.765.a:0 "The British are back in Boston!"
 amcivwar.765.b:0 "At least the socialists didn’t take Boston."

 amcivwar.766.t:0 "Socialist Drive into New England"
 amcivwar.766.d:0 "Socialist militia and soldiers have quickly occupied New England in the aftermath of their assault on Washington D.C. Although there was little resistance, it is clear that there are few friends to President Reed in the old home of Republicanism, and many are still hoping Canada will save them. For now, though, the CSA is in full control of New England."
 amcivwar.766.a:0 "Great!"
 amcivwar.766.b:0 "We’ll be back for them soon!"
 amcivwar.766.c:0 "The socialists are growing strong."

 amcivwar.767.t:0 "War Begins in Oregon"
 amcivwar.767.d.USA:0 "With the withdrawal of the Federal government west, it was obvious that General MacArthur intended to strike at the Pacific states first, seeing them as the most isolated threat. Coming over the Rocky Mountains with the last snows of winter, the 2nd and 14th Army Divisions commenced an organised attack on Oregon and the southern part of Washington. National Guardsmen in those states either sided with President MacArthur or were forced to surrender. The forces of the Denver government soon took Portland and Yakima, and the Governors of Washington and Oregon surrendered to save themselves from syndicalist agitation and war. The 3rd, 2nd, and 14th Divisions are now preparing to take California, but the Californians have already begun a counterattack, just as the Union strikes towards Arkansas once more, and the CSA moves on North Carolina. \n\nAll across the splintered and fractured nation, the splinter factions have seen their chance to begin offensive operations against all competing governments, and from Minnesota to North Carolina, from New York City to New Mexico, skirmishes and civil unrest have at last escalated to battles. It is clear to all that the Second American Civil War has begun."

Coming over the Rocky Mountains with the last snows of winter, the 2nd Army Division commenced an organised attack on Oregon and the southern part of Washington. Happily for the defenders, a militia early warning system in Oregon managed to bring the Californian guard out to defend La Grande, managing to push out the Army from the state. The 3rd, 2nd, and 14th Divisions are now preparing a defence in Idaho and Nevada, but the Californians have already begun a counterattack, just as the Union strikes towards Arkansas once more, and the CSA moves on North Carolina.\n\nAll across the splintered and fractured nation, the splinter factions have seen their chance to begin offensive operations against all competing governments, and from Minnesota to North Carolina, from New York City to New Mexico, skirmishes and civil unrest have at last escalated to battles.

 amcivwar.767.a:0 "California cannot resist us alone."
 amcivwar.767.b:0 "We have to strike at Portland!"
 amcivwar.767.c:0 "We showed them!"
 amcivwar.767.d:0 "Traitors everywhere!"

 amcivwar.768.t:0 "Trial of the New England General Staff"
 amcivwar.768.d:0 "With New England's rebellion against our rule crushed, we have secured the breakaway region that took refuge under the Canadian arm in 1937. Two prominent generals from the opposition were Leslie Groves and Mark Clark of New England. As they await their fate, many have begun to wonder if these men were simply forced into fighting against us by the Canadians who did not wish to see their chunk of America returned home. No evidence points to any egregious acts committed by either man in their defence of New England. Furthermore, both men promise to faithfully serve the flag of [ROOT.GetNameDef] if they can receive a formal pardon from our government."
 amcivwar.768.a:0 "Issue them a pardon"
 amcivwar.768.b:0 "They cannot be trusted"

 amcivwar.800.t:0 "The Occupation of [capture_state.GetName]"
 amcivwar.800.d_none:0 "Today [From.GetAdjective] forces captured the strategic home state of [capture_state.GetName]. Our soldiers and generals are concerned about the news, but we’re confident that we will still emerge victorious in the end."
 amcivwar.800.d_level_1:0 "Today [From.GetAdjective] forces captured the strategic home state of [capture_state.GetName]. Our soldiers and generals are concerned about the news, but we’re confident that we will still emerge victorious in the end."
 amcivwar.800.d_level_2:0 "Another piece of worrying news has come into [ROOT.Capital.GetName]: today [From.GetAdjective] forces captured [capture_state.GetName], the second state we have lost. Our troops are getting even more worried than before, but we are sure we can retake it, we just need more time."
 amcivwar.800.d_level_3:0 "We received news of the loss of a third strategic state today, as [From.GetAdjective] forces occupied [capture_state.GetName]. Our army’s morale is now low, as they begin to think the war is lost, and we need to move to retake the state before it’s too late."
 amcivwar.800.d_level_4:0 "[From.GetAdjective] forces today took [capture_state.GetName], and it seems the news is having an effect on our military. After this fourth blow, our army is beginning to experience desertions, but our own generals are still confident this war can be won. The civilian morale is still kept steady behind the lines, but at the front it’s hard to find supplies."
 amcivwar.800.d_level_5:0 "After the further loss of [capture_state.GetName] today, civilian morale is quickly sliding towards defeatism. Our troops, impacted by this, are refusing to advance into battle for what some are seeing as a lost cause, even though some generals see a way forward even yet."
 amcivwar.800.d_level_6:0 "We’re experiencing more desertions day after day now, especially after the loss of [capture_state.GetName]. There are rumours of discontent in our own general staff, draft dodging is the norm, and defeatism in the civilian population is widespread. Few think we can still win this war, and even the President is doubting the strength of his cause now."
 amcivwar.800.d_level_7:0 "Our ragged divisions are now completely unwilling or unable to leave their positions. Many are surrendering once the fighting reaches them, though the flood of desertions has been dammed by promises of extra rations for soldiers. However, the citizens still in our territory, many now starving, are now mostly refusing to work for our war effort, and our bullets and broken guns are not being replaced."
 amcivwar.800.d_level_8:0 "Our forces are collapsing, we’re experiencing massive desertions, our generals are surrendering, the population hates us, and we cannot win this war anymore. Without true divine intervention, we’re doomed, and our cause with us. We hope our conqueror can take better care of the American people than we could."
 amcivwar.800.a:0 "We shall return!"
 amcivwar.800.b:0 "A great victory!"

 amcivwar.801.t:0 "The Liberation of [capture_state.GetName]"
 amcivwar.801.d:0 "Today, our forces have liberated [capture_state.GetName] from the brutal occupation caused by enemy forces. People rejoiced as our forces liberated them, and our soldiers celebrated with them. Soon, this war will end, and with it the suffering the American people are experiencing."
 amcivwar.801.a:0 "We have returned."

 amcivwar.900.t:0 "Resistance Uprising in [revolt_state.GetName]"
 amcivwar.900.d:0 "Our government has clearly failed on restoring order in [revolt_state.GetName]. Partisans aligned with the traitors around us have launched an assault in the countryside, hoping to swing the war in their chosen side's favour once more."
 amcivwar.900.a:0 "Damn it."
