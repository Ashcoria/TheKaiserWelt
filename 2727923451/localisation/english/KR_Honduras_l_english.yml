### Leaders ###
 POLITICS_HONDURAN_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "The suicide of President Andino in 1933, following the taking of the capital by peasant rebels, created a shockwave throughout Honduras. In the aftermath of the revolution a coalition of ambitious intelligentsia and military personnel took over and instituted a "great purge" of dissenters and pro-US elements. Even they could not resist the lure of the United Fruit Company however, and its stranglehold on the Honduran economy. Now in serious decay the "Peasant's Republic" holds on by using military force to control the fragile transport links around the country and has all but lost control."

#Ideas
 HON_peasant_republic:0 "Peasant Republic"
 HON_peasant_republic_desc:0 "Honduras is a 'peasant republic'; that is to say it is run by the council in the name of the peasantry, and its official name is the Peasants' and Workers' Republic of Honduras. In practice, however, this government is moribund and has ceased to represent the people."
 HON_december_revolution:0 "December Revolution"
 HON_december_revolution_desc:0 "The December Revolution took place in 1932, when peasants occupied the capital and a loose coalition of different groups took power as the "Peasants' Council of Honduras". Now the revolution is regarded by some as a failure, but by others as having not gone far enough..."
 HON_great_purge:0 "Great Purge"
 HON_great_purge_desc:0 "The Great Purge was a mass persecution of members of the armed forces, primarily the Honduran army, who had links to America. While the commercial realities of the situation meant that American influence would creep back in and the Monroe Doctrine would remain in force, it still crippled the Honduran army, which is... something, one might suppose."

#Events
 honduras.200.t:0 "State of the Army"
 honduras.200.d:0 "The Honduran Army is a small one and currently suffers from an severe lack of competent leadership due to the purges of American-connected officers that have occurred. There are two major competing schools of thought seeking to remedy this deficiency: One proposes professionalising the army into a small and elite force that is very selective, while the other espouses a large army focused entirely on defence rather than offensive operations outside of Honduras."
 honduras.200.a:0 "Point the loud end at the other guy."

 honduras.201.t:0 "Acquiring Heavy Weapons"

 honduras.202.d:0 "Honduras, and Central America in general, has a great variety in terrain. In our mountainous regions, we can train infantry to ski for improved mobility, or teach them specialised tactics for fighting in the jungles. Alternatively, we could adopt a balanced approach, and try to build an all-terrain army."
 honduras.202.a:0 "Ski troops will secure our southern regions."

#Events
 honduras.1.t:0 "The Original Banana Republic"
 honduras.1.d:0 "Having come under the domination of various US fruit companies that turned the nation into an economic enclave, Honduras came to a breaking point in 1933. A peasant uprising stormed the capital and lead to the suicide of the sitting president, but even after this catastrophe, the government established in the aftermath of the revolution became dominated once more by US interests and a clique of intelligentsia. Now what remains of Honduras' apparatus of state is a mess, purged of dissenters and relying on military force to keep the railways to the ports open."
 honduras.1.a:0 "It's not much, but it's home."

 honduras.2.t:0 "Desertions In the Army"
 honduras.2.d:0 "For a long time now, we have relied on military force to protect the narrow railways connecting plantations to ports in order to keep our economy afloat. However, with the ongoing economic crisis and political discontent, the loyalty of the Army has become uncertain, with hundreds of men quitting their posts to join up with one militia or another."
 honduras.2.a:0 "They'll come back when they're hungry."

 honduras.194.t:0 "Honduras wants to buy the USS South Dakota"
 honduras.194.d:0 "Del Valle's new American Mandate in Honduras has approached us offering to buy the armoured cruiser USS South Dakota as a prestige project for his government. Should we accept? The old girl was to be sold for scrap otherwise."

 honduras.195.a:0 "Hurrah!"

 honduras.100.t:0 "The American Economy Dips Further"
 honduras.100.d:0 "Somehow they've managed it. With the collapse of the German stock market, the investments of American firms have gone from bad to worse and the import market has fallen even further as consumer spending on all but the most essential goods bottoms out."
 honduras.100.a:0 "Not much call for bananas..."

 honduras.101.t:0 "Monroe Lapses"
 honduras.101.d:0 "Armed conflict has struck the USA, throwing her government into chaos and threatening to destroy it entirely. In these dire times, the maintenance of the Monroe Doctrine is obviously impossible."
 honduras.101.a:0 "A crisis, yes, but also an opportunity."

 honduras.102.t:0 "A Railway Bombing"

 honduras.102.a:0 "Round up some loyalists and get after them!"

 honduras.103.t:0 "Skirmishes with Deserters"

 honduras.111.b:0 "We might as well send them back."

 honduras.1122.t:0 "Anti-Salvadorian Militants"
 honduras.1122.d:0 "In response to the humiliation of our great nation by the vile Salvadorians, militant groups have begun forming near the border, dedicated to fighting off any incursion or retaliation from them. Known as the "Mancha Brava", they form a secret society of sorts, and might be valuable in the defence of the nation."

 honduras.1040.a:0 "We'll make them pay!"

 honduras.3.t:0 "The Emergency Council Session: Callejas' Rally"
 honduras.3.d:0 "While ostensibly a member of the Revolutionary Council, Venancio Callejas has always stood somewhat apart from it. Before the emergency session to deal with the political crisis, he held a rally of his supporters in public, both to rally support and as a show of force to both the Army and the Council. Indeed, many whisper that simply handing him and his Redshirts the premiership could inject the vitality that the moribund revolution needs."
 honduras.3.a:0 "Just what we need, more strongmen."

 honduras.4.t:0 "The Emergency Council Session: Castro's Connections"
 honduras.4.d:0 "General Jose Leon Castro has been a key player in rallying military support for the Council for a while now, associating with various officer's cliques and slowly forming his own band of loyalists. It is also well known that despite the anti-American policy of the Revolutionary Council, he and other members are in extensive contact with the United Fruit Company that still grips the economy. There are even murmurs in the Council that his influence would make a military regime preferable to the absolute loss of power that would accompany major reforms."

 honduras.5.d:0 "With the desertions in the Army, the repression of demonstrations has become much more difficult. Consequentially, there have been large rallies in the capital and across the countryside today as the people of Honduras make known their true feelings of discontent with the Council's regime..."

 honduras.6.t:0 "The Emergency Session"
 honduras.6.d:0 "The emergency session of the Honduran Council has begun, to decide the future of the Peasants' Republic. A large crowd has gathered outside of council chambers, with the police unwilling to disperse them. The first task of the Council is to elect a new chairman to set the agenda for the meeting. Council members Callejas and Castro have nearly come to blows over their differing views, and wild accusations are being made by either side, while Councilors Morales and Galvez have formed a united front arguing for the dissolution of the Council and its reformation as an elected body; ultimately there seems to be only a few options..."

His new state promises to be vigorous and progressive and to bring Honduras into the world of 20th century socialism."
 honduras.13.a:0 "Long Live The People!"

 honduras.14.t:0 "General Castro Takes Control"
 honduras.14.d:0 "Today, General Jose Castro was sworn in as the President of Honduras and elevated to head of the armed forces. As the chairman of the now-defunct Council he has effectively been in power for several weeks, but it seems that only now does he feel confident enough to declare a new Republic."

 HON_military_roads:0 "Military Infrastructure"
 HON_military_roads_desc:0 "In Central America, you don't just need rifles and the will to win wars, you also need the supplies to do so. The harsh terrain of the region makes supply chains hard to establish, so we should look into expanding our infrastructure as to not suffer shortages."
 HON_mil_ind_complex:0 "Military-Industrial Complex"
