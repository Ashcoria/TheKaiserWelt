 gal.1.t:0 "Galicia and Lodomeria Becomes Independent"
 gal.1.d:0 "After centuries under Habsburg rule that began with the first partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1772, Galicia and Lodomeria sees herself independent. But we are a weak state surrounded by impressive neighbours - and maybe we would do good seeking protection from Poland, the nation our territory has been taken from all these years ago."
 gal.1.a:0 "Ask to formally join Poland. (Game Over)"
 gal.1.b:0 "Galicia shall remain independent."

 gal.2.t:0 "Galicia Seeks to Join Our Nation"
 gal.2.d:0 "After centuries under Habsburg rule that began with the first partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1772, Galicia and Lodomeria sees herself independent. But being a weak state surrounded by impressive neighbours, the newly independent nation feels her very existence threatened. A diplomatic envoy arrived today to discuss an incorporation of Galicia into Polish and Romanian territory."
 gal.2.a:0 "Welcome home, brothers."

 gal.3.t:0 "Incorporating Bucovina"
 gal.3.d:0 "Being independent for only a handful of days, the Galician nation, formerly a vassal state to the Crown of Austria, has been incorporated into the Polish state. However, amongst the ethnically diverse population of Galicia, its southernmost province, the Bucovina, is home to many Romanians. As agreed in the Galician-Polish treaty of unification, we are now the new owners of Bucovina."
 gal.3.a:0 "Welcome home, brothers."

 gal.7.t:0 "Karl Albrecht Elected as King of Poland"

Karl Albrecht is expected to leave the nation early tomorrow to take up his new position as leader of the Polish people, and has left Władysław Sikorski in charge of Galicia in his absence."
 gal.7.a:0 "Wish him luck."
