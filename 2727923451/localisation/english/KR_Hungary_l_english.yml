 HUN_KOCSARD_JANKY_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§L February 11, 1868, in Déva, Hungary, Austria-Hungary\n§YMilitary Career:§L Son of lieutenant field marshal Lajos Janky, Kocsárd completed his studies at the Theresian Military Academy, the Monarchy's top institution, in 1889, and was commissioned a lieutenant in the 1st Hussar Regiment. By 1909, he held the rank of major and became the chief of staff of the 1st Cavalry Division. At the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, he commanded the 4th Hussar Regiment, as a colonel, in the bloody opening battles in Galicia. He was unfortunate enough to participate in the 1916 Battle of Lutsk, one of the opening battles of the Brusilov Offensive, but his remarkable bravery and leadership in the face of relentless Russian assaults later earned him the Order of Maria Theresia, one of Austria-Hungary's top military orders of bravery. In 1917, he was transferred to the Italian Front, then the Romanian Front the following year. In the final phases of the war, he was a well-decorated general on the Macedonian Front, contributing to the final battles in that sector. After the war, he was quickly recognised as one of the more able Hungarian officers in the Monarchy and quickly rose further to the top as a General of Cavalry. As such, he is one of the most prominent Hungarian officers in the Imperial and Royal Army along with his personal friend Miklós Horthy."
 HUN_HUGO_SONYI_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§L March 2, 1883, in Waltensdorf, Austria-Hungary\n§YMilitary Career:§L After graduating from a cadet school in Budapest in 1990, Sónyi, born Solarcz, began his military service as an officer in the 4th Bosnian Infantry Regiment. He enrolled in Vienna’s Kriegsschule in 1906 and completed his staff officer courses in 1909. He was then assigned to the XIII Corps headquartered in Zagreb, and would serve in the Serbian and Italian fronts during the Weltkrieg. In the final phases of the war, he was on the Macedonian Front where he distinguished himself, ending the war at the rank of major general. After the war, Sónyi was assigned to the Honvéd Ministry until 1929. In 1927, he was further promoted to lieutenant general, becoming one of the prominent forces behind the development of the Honvéd. As of 1936, he was made General of Infantry, making him one of the highest ranked Hungarians in the Austro-Hungarian Army, and certainly one of the most respected in the armed forces."
 HUN_VILMOS_NAGY_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\nBorn:§L May 30, 1884, in Parajd, Hungary, Austria-Hungary\n§YMilitary Career:§L From distinguished Transylvanian nobility of Calvinist faith, Nagy was able to graduate from the Ludovika Military Academy with top grades, allowing him to continue studying at Vienna's Kriegsschule to become a staff officer.

He received the Military Merit Cross in 1915, briefly transferring to the War Ministry in Vienna and Honvéd Ministry in Budapest until 1916, and once more in 1918. By the end of the war, he was a colonel, and he spent the better part of the 1920s publishing several volumes analysing the Serbian and Romanian Campaigns for the armed forces. As a result, not only is he known as a prolific writer in military circles, but also as a forward-thinking officer embracing new technologies (\"Mobility, speed, and surprise will take on a new meaning in the war of the future\") with great concern for the lives of the common soldiery. As such, since becoming a general in 1934, he is well-respected as a humanitarian, a rare sight in the Austro-Hungarian armed forces. \n\n§L\"When it comes to matters of national defence, I see no races or denominations, only good and bad soldiers.\""
