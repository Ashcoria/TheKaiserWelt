#Entente Allies
 NEE_entente_allies:0 "Supporting the Entente"
 NEE_entente_allies_desc:0 "Our ties to Canada means we are a member of the Entente - whether we like it or not. The British have a great deal of experience and technology, however, which we can use to considerable advantage - though the more we do so, the more we lose legitimacy as a separate and distinct government."

 NEE_declare_independence_from_CAN:0 "The Second Declaration of Independence"
 NEE_declare_independence_from_CAN_desc:0 "We didn't want it to come to this, but it appears we must: in order for New England to be free, we must declare our independence from [CAN.GetNameDef] and their alliance. If they intend to fight us on this decision, then we must be prepared to meet them in battle."

#Reclaiming America
 NEE_reclaiming_america:0 "Reclaiming America"
 NEE_reclaiming_america_desc:0 "The Liberty Bell still rings in Boston even as other parts of our fair nation have torn themselves Asunder. Ever since the Canadian intervention which created our provisional government, we have hoped for democracy to win out in the civil war. If that is not the case, then we must steel ourselves to carry the torch for freedom, as the last vestige of democratic America."

 NEE_claim_usa_territory:0 "Claim the Mantle of Free America"
 NEE_claim_usa_territory_desc:0 "Democratic America has fallen. It now falls on us to claim what is left. For Freedom and the United States!"
 NEE_liberate_states:0 "Liberate [From.GetNameDef]"
 NEE_liberate_states_desc:0 "As the keeper of American democracy, it falls upon us to take the fight to [From.GetNameDef]!"

#Defence Stratagem A
 NEE_Defence_of_New_England:0 "Defence Stratagem A"
 NEE_Defence_of_New_England_desc:0 "Our worst fears have come to be as the American Civil War is tearing up the nation from the coasts on the Pacific to the Texan oilfields to the smoking factories of the Great Lakes. We have only succeeded in escaping from the terror by the grace of the British Empire but even our future looks troubled as it is only a matter of time before the ideologically clashing blocs of the South look Northwards, ready to take back what they see as their rightful land.\n\nIt is for them that we must be prepared and defence systems must be created from the Hudson River to the streets of Boston. We may look weak on paper, but it will take every last drop of real American blood to take us down."

 NEE_air_defence_of_the_territory:0 "Deploy the Anti-Air Defence System"
 NEE_air_defence_of_the_territory_desc:0 "Modern War has shown the value of an air force and the massive destruction it can cause upon the armies of old. Whilst we are desperately trying to keep in the air race, our industrial facilities are far smaller than those of our enemies which has prompted High Command to focus instead on the creation of an elaborate Anti-Air defence system capable of nullifying the air superiority of our opponents."

 NEE_hudson_line:0 "Fortify the Hudson Line"
 NEE_hudson_line_desc:0 "Flowing down towards the great city of New York, the Hudson river is of great value to any would be defender. Placing §YBunkers§! on its river banks may prove to be of great value in stopping the Southern threat."

 NEE_connecticut_line:0 "Fall back to the Connecticut River"
 NEE_connecticut_line_desc:0 "Whilst our main defence line lies on the Hudson river, one must always prepare for the unforeseen and as such we should consider creating a line of equal strength behind the Connecticut River. They may have gotten the better of us at the Hudson, but their offence stops here!"

 NEE_boston_last_stand:0 "Our Last Stand"
 NEE_boston_last_stand_desc:0 "The rivers have been breached and enemy troops are flooding the New Englander countryside. Boston still stands yet general evacuation of its civilian population has already been decreed. "It may seem that the war is turning against us, but the men and women of Boston shall not go gently into the night. We are the last bastion of American democracy; their last hope and it is here that this madness stops!""
 NEE_last_stand_tt:0 "3 Divisions of §GNew Englander Volunteers§! will spawn in §YBoston§! to defend the city\n"

#Sway Public Opinion
 NEE_Sway_Public_Opinion:0 "Establishing Legitimacy"
 NEE_Sway_Public_Opinion_desc:0 "We are a government that has been put into place by a foreign power - and thus many are keen to disregard our right to exist, or to call us traitors for not weighing in on the civil war raging in the rest of the nation. We must combat the opinion that we serve British interests rather than American citizens, and that involves changing attitudes at home. Failure to do so means the eventual dissolution of our government once the civil war is finished - or worse.\n\nCurrent Legitimacy :  §G[?NEE.NEE_legitimacy]§!"

 NEE_national_propaganda_campaign:0 "Organise a Propaganda Campaign"
 NEE_national_propaganda_campaign_desc:0 "Billboards, Radio Commercials, Newspaper Ads and much more, all will be pushed down the people’s throats in the hopes of conveying our message."

 NEE_presidential_goodwill_tour:0 "Hold a Presidential Goodwill Tour"
 NEE_presidential_goodwill_tour_desc:0 "Even as our propaganda ministry works around the clock, the man on the street remains unconvinced that actual power is wielded in Boston and sees the "president" as nothing more than a Canadian sock puppet happily following all orders from Ottawa. By touring the president and the elected cabinet around New England we hope to further convince the people that their real president and leader is very much [NEE.GetLeader]"

 NEE_bribe_foreign_press:0 "'Motivate' the Foreign Press"
 NEE_bribe_foreign_press_desc:0 "Journalists from all sides of the world keep having this annoying habit of reporting news within our nation as matters of the 'New Englander' state with socialist-aligned papers even going so far as calling us the Canadian Province of New England. This will no longer do for we will not be trifled with and they shall soon recognise that the only true American nation is ours. For now, however we'll have to be content with sliding some money towards the largest troublemakers and politely requesting that they call us the United States of America."

 NEE_foreign_representation:0 "Increase Foreign Representation in R&D"
 NEE_foreign_representation_desc:0 "The war may be raging harder than ever before but American scientists are still working in the labs and engineering facilities of the Ivy League universities. Let's make it clear that [Root.GetNameDef] has the wherewithal to innovate and stand on its own among the world leaders."

 NEE_labour_relation_act:0 "Pass the Labour Relation Act"
 NEE_labour_relation_act_desc:0 "A key source of the chaos to the south was the unmitigated exploitation of the working class by the elite. We need to avoid this occurring here by protecting workers' rights"

#Freedom Fliers
 NEE_Dropping_Propaganda:0 "The 'Freedom Fliers'"
 NEE_Dropping_Propaganda_desc:0 "The airplane has not only revolutionised the way we travel, transport goods or even wage warfare but also the ways with which we can spread our messages. Through the use of balloons, bombers and even just your regular fighter, the Freedom Fliers initiative has been tasked with flying deep over enemy territory to wage not the physical but the psychological war hoping to disrupt the minds of those that may not fully be on board with the nation they are fighting for."

 NEE_Choosing_our_Propaganda:0 "Choosing our Message"
 NEE_Choosing_our_Propaganda_desc:0 "Even though there is an agreement that the Freedom Fliers should depart for the skies, dispute still rules in the ministry of propaganda as the search for the 'perfect' message knows no end and designers are sent back to the drawing board."

 NEE_prop_choice_made:0 "We have chosen our §YMessage§!"

 NEE_For_Home_and_Fatherland:0 "Fly over §Y[USA.GetNameWithFlag]§!"

#Liberty Ship Project
 NEE_Liberty_Ship_Program:0 "Liberty Ship Program"
 NEE_Liberty_Ship_Program_desc:0 "With war on the European continent inevitable and with the Ententes ambitions to execute the largest naval operation in the history of mankind, the dockyards of New England are working overtime to meet the increasing needs of the alliance. To further boost our output, a centralised construction scheme has been created by the government to guide the further expansion of these shipyards."

 NEE_GUI_Airdrop:0 "§YAirdrop Supplies for the Resistance§!"
 NEE_GUI_Airdrop_desc:0 "§gBy employing the "Freedom Fliers" we will perform fast and precise strikes into enemy territory dropping supplies over known resistance HQs where our operatives on the ground will arm possible sympathisers to harass the enemy from behind.§!\n\n[!NEE_Airdrop_button_click_enabled]"

If we strike quickly and seize the region, we could close a weak point on our eastern flank and strengthen our position against any invasion from a hostile southern power. All but abandoned by their government, we anticipate our New England cousins will welcome our intervention."

The Canadian government has sent us notification of their intent, and has stressed that they only wish to safeguard the lives of innocents and that they will discuss the matter further with the American government once peace has been restored. While some in the [Root.GetAdjective] cabinet feel the Canadians have violated our sovereignty, there is little we can do about it at the moment."

 newengland.3.d:0 "New England has been besieged by syndicalist militia violence, and the governors in the region are terrified that the Federal government won't be able to prevent a rapid takeover of the entire region. Apparently they went so far as to formally request an intervention by [CAN.GetNameDef], but the Canadian government has declined to get involved... at least as of yet. As a result, militia groups in Boston are rapidly mobilising to try and organise a proper defence of the area."

 newengland.5.t:0 "The Question of New England"
 newengland.5.d:0 "Now that we have intervened in New England, a number of Canadian ministers have met with leaders from those states regarding how best to keep order. The states have suggested setting up a provisional government for the region, one that would - at least initially - be under our control and brought into the Entente alliance. Some members of the government, however, have suggested it would be better if we simply occupied and adminstered the territory ourselves. Americans, they say, can sometimes be of suspect loyalty - grateful or not, their goals may not mirror our own."

Some members of the Canadian government are taken aback by the tone of the demand, seeing as the Canadian government is what enabled New Englanders to avoid the chaos rampant in the rest of America, though others (perhaps rightly) point out that unless Canada's ambition is to govern Americans as colonial subjects there is no reason not to give New England what it seeks."

 newengland.13.a:0 "We are grateful."

 newengland.14.t:0 "Canada Refuses"
 newengland.14.d:0 "Perhaps deciding that we are too valuable an asset in their quest to retake the Home Isles, or perhaps secretly coveting New England's territory as their own, the Canadian government has refused to grant New England home rule. We are, at least for the foreseeable future, their subject... something which has provided a serious blow to our government's legitimacy."

 newengland.40.t:0 "The Great New England Hurricane of 1938"
 newengland.40.d:0 "What was first considered a non-issue, the Yankee Clipper Hurricane arrived on Long Island September 21st and would only a few hours later turn out to be largest Hurricane to set foot in New England since the Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635.\n\nMoving North from Long Island to Connecticut, Rhode Island and up through Vermont the storm cost the lives of close to 700 people. By the end of the devastation over 57,000 homes were destroyed or damaged and road networks all across the New England region lay in tatters with projections estimating that it would take us months or even years just to re-open them to traffic."
 newengland.40.a:0 "God save us all."

### Underground Railroad ###
 newengland.50.t:0 "The Underground Railroad"
 newengland.50.d:0 "Established in the 1700s, the first Underground Railroad served as a network of secret routes with as purpose to clandestinely transport Afro-American slaves from the Thirteen Colonies into Canada where slavery was already abolished.\n\nWith the American Civil War tearing apart households across the Americans and ideological strive leading to the forced expulsion or sometimes even massacre of Americans, our government has reignited the old "Railroad" and has with the aid of locals on both sides of the border re-established the network with the hopes of safely transporting refugees to our little nation."
 newengland.50.a:0 "There is only so much we can do though..."

#CSA
 newengland.51.t:0 "The Lake Erie Migration Crisis"
 newengland.51.d:0 "The war has only been raging for a few weeks now as opposing forces fight it out around the Great Lakes. As comrade shoots comrade and the battlelines shift in both directions, one can not forget the tremendous loss of civilian life.\n\nOften caught in the midst of battle, decimated in bombing raids or executed by fanatics of either side, these people have been fleeing en-masse from the fighting towards our nation. As the land route is becoming more dangerous by the day, vast swathes of shaky tubs have been spotted on Lake Erie in a desperate attempt to reach our peaceful sanctuary. The condition of these rafts is often so dire that many don't even make it across the border, let alone into our safe hands. Relief organisations such as United America and the Red Cross have flocked to the coastline of the lake to help those that survive the perilous journey, often undertaken under cover of the night. They now ask that the government provides them with more means to rescue those coming across and to sweep our side of the lake for survivors.\n\nPragmatists in the Army however have seen an opportunity in this Great Migration to smuggle weaponry and equipment from the CSA into our hands. They propose that we send covert agents to Detroit and Cleveland who will then smuggle the goods on the refugee rafts towards our patrol boats."
 newengland.51.a:0 "Allow covert operatives to establish a base on Pelee Island."
 newengland.51.b:0 "We can not put the lives of innocents in danger with our schemes!"

 newengland.52.t:0 "Successful Smuggling Operation on Lake Erie"
 newengland.52.d:0 "Tucked away beneath sheets of linen and between the clothes of refugees, our covert operatives on the far side of Lake Erie have been able to successfully smuggle small arms, munition, medical supplies. Even heavier equipment such as artillery shells and dismantled mortars have been carried across by efforts of our, American, people being nothing short of heroic. Thus far the Syndies suspect nothing but it would seem only natural that one day our luck will run out..."
 newengland.52.a:0 "Piece by piece we pick away at the carcass"

 newengland.53.t:0 "Smugglers Apprehended!"
 newengland.53.d:0 "Our good fortune couldn't last and yesterday was once again further proof of this. Although nothing seemed out of the ordinary on the smuggler boats, a slight deviation on the schedule of the Cleveland harbour patrol caught our operatives in the midst of the crime. Words could not explain why there were dozens of ammo chests and carbines on an unmarked vessel and it didn't take long until the boat was brought back to shore and our agents locked behind bars."
 newengland.53.a:0 "Change the course of the routes, we can not stop the operation!"
 newengland.53.b:0 "It's too risky, we should focus on the refugee program."

 newengland.54.t:0 ""Jack" the Doberman"
 newengland.54.d:0 "As man falls back into his usual routine of killing his neighbours, the animal world is not spared from the violence either. A happy story however emerged from Connecticut where a young Doberman, ironically enough named Jack, was able to stop militia agents from blowing up a bomb in Hartford.\n\nThe dog was training in cooperation with the Connecticut National Guard when his patrol spotted the agents who promptly tried to escape from capture. With the courage of a true American, the little dog immediately ran after them and pulled one of the two men down leading to his capture. This man later turned out to be none other than Paul Rashford, a target long sought after by the Hartford Police Department for his implication in the riots only a few months earlier and who seems to have established a whole network of operatives in Connecticut.\n\nWhilst his capture by no means marks the end of the socialist threat in the state, 'Jack' has dealt a heavy blow to their leadership."
 newengland.54.a:0 "We express our thanks to this good boy!"

 newengland.55.t:0 "Refugees from the CSA"
 newengland.55.d:0 "The horrors of war keep raging in [CSA.GetNameDef] and the large migratory wave from theirs into our territory seems to know no end. Just as last month, the Underground Railroad has once again led to the successful transfer of thousands of these war refugees into our Safe Harbour."
 newengland.55.a:0 "Let us pray the violence will end soon."

#TEX
 newengland.56.t:0 "Refugees from the AUS"
 newengland.56.d:0 "Although the journey is full of peril and even though bandits and/or criminals stalk the trails from the deep South all the way to Connecticut, thousands still depart on the journey hoping that they may find peace and a protector in our nation."
 newengland.56.a:0 "Welcome to New England!"

 newengland.57.t:0 "Pelley Asserts Control in the AUS"
 newengland.57.d:0 "It came as no surprise to the people of America that Huey Long served only as a tool for the far more dangerous Pelley. Today the power struggle within the leadership of the Union State finally came to a head as Pelley himself has officially been sworn in as President and has already started to implement his policies of far-reaching racism and his wishes to achieve a White Christian Nation.\n\nIt goes without saying that the response to these events in the Black Belt has been far from welcoming as hundreds of thousands of Afro-American citizens now fear for their future and look North to us in the hopes of finding a safe haven far away from Pelley’s cronies."
 newengland.57.a:0 "We have no place for them either!"
 newengland.57.b:0 "Install strict refugee quotas and only allow a select few in."
 newengland.57.c:0 "In Boston one is not discriminated for the colour of his skin!"

 newengland.58.t:0 "Unchecked Migration"
 newengland.58.d:0 "What started as a few hundred, rapidly became tens of thousands as Pelley’s anti-black policy has scared the Afro-American citizens northwards into our territory. Border guards are unable to keep up with the increasing amount of refugees and government institutions and relief organisations are struggling to provide shelter and food to those who have lost their home. We need to step in and do so now or we will risk our own nation collapsing under the weight of these people who more often than not have used all their resources to make it to our border.\n\nA hard choice will have to be made between restricting the amount of refugees coming and thus leaving them at the mercy of Pelley’s regime in the South or to let them all freely cross the border and risk straining our own nation. Relief organisations like United America have already denounced certain political figures who have spoken out against the unchecked migration but even they are now realising that resources are rapidly decreasing, and the flood keeps increasing."
 newengland.58.a:0 "Close the Border!"
 newengland.58.b:0 "We are the only hope these people have, let them in!"

 newengland.59.t:0 "Appointing the New England Poet Laureate"
 newengland.59.d:0 "The position of Poet laureate has been discussed within state politics for a few years now. A single person to represent the corpus of hundreds of artists against the tide of film and popular music as an art form. The New England congress has decided to create this title along with a re-consecration of the Boston Athenæum as the temporary Library of Congress. The top candidate in the congressional poll is Robert Frost, who exhibits a distinctly New England mastery of modernist poetry. Public polls, however, has shown favour for the pulp fiction writer H.P Lovecraft. Lovecraft has written in the papers that he would accept this award, but not appear in public for the ceremony. The Library of Congress is in a bind."
 newengland.59.a:0 "Robert Frost, Modernist Master."
 newengland.59.b:0 "H.P Lovecraft, the master of horror."

 newengland.60.t:0 "Intervention for John Winant"
 newengland.60.d:0 "The private life of President Winant is not the proper subject of newspaper gossip, but after today, it is a public issue. President Winant's minders found a loaded gun in his bedroom tonight, and after a panic determined their was no intended assassin. President Winant confessed to his minders that his secret affair with Sarah Churchill ended, and he is distraught over the potential political fallout for indiscretions with a major Canadian politician's daughter. Fortunately, Winston Churchill was very gently notified, and forgave President Winant in person. Winant has decided to take a few days break to recuperate mentally."
 newengland.60.a:0 "He just needs a few days off."

 newengland.61.t:0 "Gerry Campaigns for Mackenzie King"
 newengland.61.d:0 "Long before his career in politics, Peter Gerry was a student at Harvard. There, he was tutored by Canadian Deputy Minister of Labour William Lyon King. These lessons had a major impact on Gerry. Now, King is a major Liberal politician whose allies stateside are the Republicans and the Liberals. As a President, Gerry has talked with his advisers about crossing the party line to help his old mentor. This would invariably debase the Democrats, and aid the Liberals in America. "
 newengland.61.a:0 "Don't cross party lines!"
 newengland.61.b:0 "Gerry can campaign as he pleases."

 newengland.62.t:0 "Cocoanut Grove Fire Traced Back to Tobin"
 newengland.62.d:0 "A massive fire erupted in the popular Boston nightclub, Cocoanut Grove, leaving almost 500 people dead. Among the victims are several high ranking American immigrants, and the uproar searching for an answer has raced the highest halls of power. It appears that several mid-level Democratic party politicians had taken bribes earlier this month before an inspection. This inspection was independently determined to be insufficient, and the public prosecutor is preparing a case alledging massive conspiracy. This has rocked public support for Democrats across New England."
 newengland.62.a:0 "A shame upon the city."

 newengland.63.t:0 "Rockefeller Center Artifacts Recovered, Some Defaced"
 newengland.63.d:0 "Since the abandoning of New York City to the militant unions, Nelson has sought to recover whatever he can from his prized Rockefeller Center. It appears now, that most of the artwork installed in the skyscraper is now for sale, which Nelson took advantage of. When these relics of a peaceful America arrived, we were all ashamed to find them defaced. It appears Diego Rivera, whose murals were rejected for installation, took it upon himself to replace images of Zeus with Marx. Among several other mythological heroes were all strategically replaced with their respective socialist myth-men. These priceless works of art are ruined."
 newengland.63.a:0 "I'll get you Rivera, someday!"

 newengland.64.t:0 "Canadians Apply for West Point"
 newengland.64.d:0 "The Class of 1944 has just arrived, and their numbers are far below expectations. As it is still necessary for Senators to recommend prospective young men, the decrease from 100 new cadets to just 14. It has been suggested that we allow Canadian politicians to recommend their young men to West Point. We are in dire need of new officers, and yet at the same time, this time honoured tradition ensures that this institution isn't used by foreign powers, much less the Crown."
 newengland.64.a:0 "Absolutely not!"
 newengland.64.b:0 "We do need the people."

### Freedom Fliers ###
 newengland.70.t:0 "Choosing Our Propaganda"
 newengland.70.d:0 "The "Freedom Fliers" initiative has been activated by our government but there is still much discussion about the content of the dropped messages as the right message could wreak havoc behind their lines but the wrong message could further bolster their resolve.\n\nWhether to strike the civilian population or the armed forces directly also remains a topic for debate as some have argued that the enemy homefront would be more susceptible to our message but a direct strike on their armed forces could lead to a more direct effect."
 newengland.70.a:0 "Attempt to disrupt their attack plans with wrong information."
 newengland.70.b:0 "Trick their troops in leaving gaps in their defences."
 newengland.70.c:0 "Spread uncertainty on their Home Front."
 newengland.70.e:0 "Try to demoralise their troops."

 newengland.71.t:0 "The Tale of Private Bob 'Daredevil' Rogers"
 newengland.71.d:0 "Private Bob had always been a well-known name in the corps of the Freedom Fliers but it was his recent heroic actions above enemy territory that earned him his nickname 'Daredevil'.\n\nSent out with 5 other members of his squadron, he and his compatriots got surprised by an anti air installation that had been placed there after rumours of incursions into their air zone. Bad intel on our part ultimately led to disaster as the entire group of planes was shredded to pieces with only Private Bob and one of his crew mates surviving the crash. Landing deep behind enemy lines and with no way to reach our own positions, the two men took it upon themselves to perform a series of guerrilla actions in the region, achieving critical success in hindering enemy supply lines and successfully forcing their command to deploy further troops to the region.\n\nTheir success would however not continue much longer as an attempt to recruit possible sympathisers amidst the civilian population backfired and a setup orchestrated to finally kill the two men led to the death of Bobs fellow soldier and the loss of his right ear.\n\nNow alone, out of ammunition and still with no way to return to base, Bob travelled all the way North to Lake Erie whilst always staying one step ahead of the enemy agents tracking him down.\n\nEmbarking with 50 refugees on a shaky vessel, Bob finally made it back into New York last week. Having been stuck alone with no contact deep behind enemy lines, it took the brave man 50 days to make his way back into our country leaving a trail of sabotage in his wake. Although granted leave by his commanding officers to recover from his adventure, Bob has reportedly already signed up for the next flight claiming that he would do it all over again for his beloved nation."
 newengland.71.a:0 "The American nation thanks her son for his service!"

 newengland.73.t:0 "Sabotage on the Bedford Army Air Field"
 newengland.73.d:0 "Under cover of darkness and with support from within, foreign operatives have succeeded in causing massive damage to the fighter planes stationed in Bedford. Dozens of planes have been lost or damaged and the hangars have suffered from various small explosions. We have thus far been unable to stop them and there isn't even an answer as to which faction the saboteurs adhere."
 newengland.73.a:0 "Are we blind? Deploy the garrison!"

 newengland.80.t:0 "The Yankee Rebellion"
 newengland.80.d:0 "While our intention upon occupying New England was to safeguard the locals from the ravages of the American Civil War, it seems many of them have taken exception. Several leaders in Boston have publicly accused Canada of desiring solely to return the area to British rule, to squeeze whatever we can out of the region so that we can return to the Home Isles, and that they would have been better off throwing their lot in with their American brothers and sisters. The fever pitch in the area has reached the point where we may have to reconsider our plan for New England self-government... or face a long period of uprisings."
 newengland.80.a:0 "This will amount to nothing."
 newengland.80.b:0 "Bah, very well - set up the provisional government."

 newengland.85.t:0 "Yankee Rebellion Over"
 newengland.85.d:0 "It has taken many months, but it appears the so-called Yankee Rebellion in New England is over. Resistance leaders have either been captured or fled, and the remaining local governments all seem to be on board with the Canadian government - spurred on, one imagines, by the pictures of devastation throughout the rest of America playing across their newspaper pages. We should see no further trouble in the area."
 newengland.85.a:0 "Finally!"

 newengland.90.t:0 "Rejoining America"
 newengland.90.d.forced:0 "Officials arrived today from [From.GetNameDef] to begin negotiations about a peaceful reunion between our government and theirs. There was little time to discuss the matter in Boston, however, as almost instantly a public campaign swept across the country demanding we dissolve the government at once. New England, the public feels, is not a real country - and its government does not have sufficient legitimacy to refuse the [From.GetAdjective] request."
 newengland.90.d.choice:0 "Officials arrived today from [From.GetNameDef] to begin negotiations about a peaceful reunion between our government and theirs, now that the civil war is over and the victor decided. There are many who feel that the main purpose of New England's provisional government - to avoid the chaos of the civil war - has been served, and we should become part of America once again. There are others, however, who feel that New England has achieved its own sense of legitimacy. We have a place in the British sphere, and is being a part of [From.GetNameDef] what we truly want? Are they truly the America we remember?"
 newengland.90.a:0 "It seems we have no choice but to agree..."
 newengland.90.b:0 "We should rejoin America."
 newengland.90.c:0 "No, this is not in our best interests."

 newengland.91.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap]'s Request"
 newengland.91.d:0 "The ambassador from [From.GetNameDef] has met with [Root.GetAdjective] officials and presented their plan: they wish to peacefully reunite with [requester.GetNameDef], effective immediately. Now that the civil war is done, they believe the purpose of New England's provisional government - namely to avoid the chaos and destruction - is also passed. America, they say, must be one once more. There is a mixed reaction within the government, though most agree that [requester.GetNameDef] will not sit idly by should we refuse."
 newengland.91.a:0 "Then we wish them well."
 newengland.91.b:0 "We agree, if [requester.GetNameDef] joins the Entente."
 newengland.91.c:0 "No, we cannot permit that."

 newengland.92.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Agrees"
 newengland.92.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has agreed that the provisional government's purpose is done. They hold no claim over the New England region and wish no conflict with [requester.GetNameDef], nor intend to make any demands upon them for New England's return. [From.GetAdjective] forces have begun to leave the area immediately."
 newengland.92.a:0 "Wonderful news!"

 newengland.93.t:0 "Reunion with New England"
 newengland.93.d:0 "Officials from New England delivered the message promptly: they will gladly unite with [Root.GetNameDef] at once. The purpose of their provisional government - to avoid the chaos of the civil war - is now over with, and they look forward to America being whole once again."
 newengland.93.a:0 "Excellent!"

 newengland.94.t:0 "The Canadian Concern"
 newengland.94.d:0 "While the New England government is not a Canadian puppet, it would be false to suggest that it wasn't part of the British sphere - such as it is - and of great concern to the larger Canadian sphere of interest. The Canadian government is willing to allow New England to reunite with [requester.GetNameDef], since the reason for Canada's intervention in the region ended with the civil war, but they are asking that [requester.GetNameDef] join the Entente alliance. This would make up for New England's loss, and also be a way to pay back [CAN.GetNameDef] for saving American lives."
 newengland.94.a:0 "We'll see where this goes..."
 newengland.94.b:0 "We're fine with that request."
 newengland.94.c:0 "No, they have no right to make that demand."

 newengland.95.t:0 "[requester.GetNameDefCap] Agrees"
 newengland.95.d:0 "Officials from [requester.GetNameDef] have returned with agreement - they will join the Entente in exchange for a peaceful reunion with New England, and as a way to pay back [Root.GetNameDef] for safeguarding so many American lives during the civil war."
 newengland.95.a:0 "Might amenable of them!"

 newengland.96.t:0 "[requester.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 newengland.96.d:0 "Officials from [requester.GetNameDef] have returned to Canada with a flat refusal - they will not bargain for New England's return, particularly since [CAN.GetNameDef] had no right to intervene in the civil war in the first place. The officials say that Canada took control of New England to safeguard themselves against radical forces, nothing more. With that threat gone, America should once again be whole."
 newengland.96.a:0 "I wish mommy and daddy would stop fighting..."
 newengland.96.b:0 "Very well, let them go."
 newengland.96.c:0 "Then we refuse."

 newengland.97.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 newengland.97.d.forced:0 "The Canadian government has returned to New England with a flat refusal - we may not rejoin America. It seems their promises of self-government, and their assurances that the intervention was for our safety, were all simply a sham. Since the New England lacks sufficient legitimacy to act as anything but a Canadian puppet, it has dissolved in a spasm of in-fighting and fury against the Canadians."
 newengland.97.d.choice:0 "The Canadian government has returned to New England with a flat refusal - we may not rejoin America. It seems their promises of self-government, and their assurances that the intervention was for our safety, were all simply a sham: they intervened to safeguard British interests, nothing more. Now the New England government must decide for itself where its interests lie, and perhaps spark a war either way."
 newengland.97.a:0 "So be it!"
 newengland.97.b:0 "We will join [requester.GetNameDef] anyhow!"
 newengland.97.c:0 "We remain with [From.GetNameDef]"

 newengland.98.t:0 "New England Dissolves"
 newengland.98.d:0 "With our refusal to allow New England to rejoin [requester.GetNameDef], their government has utterly dissolved due to internal conflict and a sense of it having no true legitimacy. The region is once again under our control, and very possibly may lead us into a war with [requester.GetNameDef]."
 newengland.98.a:0 "So be it!"

 newengland.99.t:0 "[war_country.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 newengland.99.d.exists:0 "For reasons not well understood, the New England government has decided that its best interests are served remaining a part of the British sphere.

 newengland.99.d.notexists:0 "While it appears New Englanders were more than willing to join with us peacefully, the Canadian intervention has exposed their provisional government for what it was: a puppet, subject to the will of the British crown. With their refusal to allow New England to choose its own destiny, the New England government has collapsed and been re-absorbed into [CAN.GetNameDef]."
 newengland.99.a:0 "Then it's war!"

 NEE_LESLIE_GROVES_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L August 17, 1896, in Albany, New York State, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L Leslie Richard Groves Jr. was born in a family with quite a history in the military, considering his father had served in the Spanish-American War, the Philippines and the Boxer Rebellion. During his late high-school years, Groves started to enrol in courses at the University of Washington, hoping to get an appointment to the United States Military Academy. He got his wish when President Woodrow Wilson himself allowed him to compete for his vacancy, but his grades weren't high enough to be accepted. Instead, Groves joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the meantime while he prepared to retake West Point's entrance exam. In 1916, he took the entrance exam again, and was accepted, visiting the European battlefields on an educational tour in 1919 and graduating in 1920 as a second lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers, thanks to his experience in MIT. He was posted with the 4th Engineer corps stationed at Camp Lewis, and would later be moved to Fort Worden, where he'd meet his future wife, Grace Wilson. In late 1922, he was posted in Hawaii with the 3rd Engineer corps at the Schofield Barracks, where he earned a commendation for helping construct a trail from Kahuku to Pupukea.

In his time in West Point, he met and befriended Dwight Eisenhower, and Clark graduated in April 1917 alongside Matthew Ridgway and J. Lawton Collins as a second lieutenant. Like his grandfather, he chose to serve in the Infantry corps where he was assigned to the 11th Infantry Regiment.

As the internal situation deteriorated, Clark was on leave in New York, and when hostilities broke out, he moved to New England looking for safety. With the lack of capable staff, Clark has been hastily promoted to Brigadier General, where he'll now have to oversee the creation of a new army.\n§YImportant Notes:§L- While his loyalty is unquestioned, his friendship with now enemy Generals have raised concerns that General Clark will be unable to do his duty when the time comes to face them openly on the battlefield."

He was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in March 1935, and was assigned to the Infantry School at Fort Benning, in Georgia.
