### Traits ###
 TEX_the_kingfish:0 "The Kingfish"

### Leaders ###
 POLITICS_GEORGE_VAN_HORN_MOSELEY:0 "Forty years of service for the United States Army from a cavalry lieutenant in the Philippines to a Commissioned Officer in Washington has created a strong portfolio for Moseley. Experiences serving alongside generals like George Patton and General MacArthur influenced his eventual decision to support Huey Long and his adamant belief in Jewish conspiracy. Ultimately his belief in the dangers of any form of socialism made him the perfect spokesman of the War Powers Committee. Without Moseley would be impossible for the War Powers Committee to succeed Huey Long in the disappearance that Moseley was complicit in, so say the rumours."
 POLITICS_WILLIAM_DUDLEY_PELLEY:0 "At age thirty-nine William Pelley was a rather unimaginative Hollywood screenwriter and journalist. His past adventures mostly consisting of visiting Russia and absorbing anti-Semitic pamphlets. By the time of his founding the Silver Legion in 1933, Pelley had transformed into a vocal Anglo-Saxon supremacist and militant spiritualist. With Pelley's spiritualism being reserved for trusted allies only. After his organisation was sponsored by Huey Long, he met and formulated the Pelley-Armstrong Line with Herbert W. Armstrong, a fellow Anglo-Saxon supremacist. Conniving, anti-socialism and a belief in Christian Identity forms the backbone of his regime."
 POLITICS_GERALD_L_K_SMITH:0 "For decades thought to be a follower more than a leader, Gerald Smith has come onto his own after joining the Silver Legion in 1937 while on the evangelical circuit. An ordained Minister in his early life, Smith first came under the influence of Huey Long's Share Our Wealth society. Smith was brought under the wing of William Pelley when Pelley displayed a trumped-up endorsement from Huey Long. An important turning point in is career came when the Share Our Wealth society appointed him to replace Huey Long following the Prohibition debacle. Smith had then served under Pelley as a handler to stop the Chief's frequent public outbursts."
 POLITICS_EARL_KEMP_LONG_DESC:0 "Once denied the Lieutenant Governor's post by his brother Huey Long in 1932, Earl Long has long lived in his brother's shadow. Earl was known in Congress for his progressive policies, but also for supporting the AFP's authority over state government. As the pre-determined successor to Huey Long years before his death, Earl displays the same reformist agenda, but with a more socially conservative and indulgent touch. It is under Earl Long that Huey Long's eduction and welfare reforms were really put into practice during those tense years. Whispers of Earl's racist remarks and of mental instability are covered up by the AFP."
 POLITICS_CHARLES_LINDBERGH_DESC:0 "Charles Lindbergh, or Lindy, was once the most famous pilot in America. Lindbergh's fame grew well into the 1920s in service of the US Air Mail Service. This coupled with a knack for improving planes that eventually grew into a business made Lindbergh even more famous. Lindbergh's association with the AFP starting in 1932, and escalated until he made contact with the War Power Committee. Eventually picked out of the Committee to be their next leader, Lindbergh intends to continue Moseley's racialist positions and to encourage industrial innovations through example."

### Huey Long Path ###
 TEX_new_washington:0 "The New Washington"
 TEX_new_washington_desc:0 "The new American seat of government will throw off the old shackles of Capitoline tradition and rebuild itself as a defensible and secure location for the three branches to seat power. Boulevards are now too wide for barricades, structures are now supplied with emergency power, and shelters are guaranteed for residents."
 TEX_root_out_out_traitors:0 "Root out Traitors"
 TEX_root_out_out_traitors_desc:0 "Following the trail of convicted traitors, the president has found a group of Congressmen that were in contact with business executives planning against us. Although they are now behind bars, some have eluded capture through political avenues. We are investigating whether the captured Richard Butler in his asylum will lead us to any more traitors."
 TEX_expand_the_minute_men:0 "Expand the Minutemen"
 TEX_expand_the_minute_men_desc:0 "In order to preserve the integrity of our armed forces, we must expand the Minutemen into the field of civil protection and border monitoring. The insurgent socialists and MacArthurites don't adhere to the rules of engagement anymore, therefore we must prepare for any level of brutality on their part."
 TEX_election_monitoring:0 "Election Monitoring"
 TEX_election_monitoring_desc:0 "The only force that can ensure the democratic process is carried out is the Minutemen, who shall be deployed every November to safeguard voting areas from harm. They shall keep an eye to safeguard the voting process for our third-party allies and make sure nothing goes wrong for us."
 TEX_destroy_the_klan:0 "Destroy the Klan"
 TEX_destroy_the_klan_desc:0 "Hiram Wesley Evans and his cadre of his Grand Wizards are finally arrested and brought to trial for their terroristic actions.

With their conviction we have finally pacified the most extreme that sought to poison the America First Party."
 TEX_ensure_loyalty:0 "Ensure Loyalty"
 TEX_ensure_loyalty_desc:0 "Members of Congress have devised a way to establish a baseline of trust in our democratic system that is sorely needed. The so-named Fish Act would require every party representative, labour union leader and public servant to sign an affidavit stating that they will never aid the CSA or MacArthur junta."
 TEX_reward_loyalty:0 "Reward Loyalty"
 TEX_reward_loyalty_desc:0 "The Fish Act's critics rightfully stated that there was no incentive for officials to sign the affidavits. In response a second Act is passed to provide compensation for the time spent in the public service during the Civil War that was postponed by the Federalists. This back-pay would require signing the aforementioned affidavit, of course."
 TEX_national_political_machine:0 "National Political Machine"
 TEX_national_political_machine_desc:0 "Executive acts have been used to create agencies to serve the American people in the past, so long as it does not intrude into state sovereignty. In the past, this power has led to corruption from corporate interests. The president is, however, incorruptible. Turning the tables against the monopolies and grafters is his promise to America."
 TEX_new_democracy:0 "New Democracy"
 TEX_new_democracy_desc:0 "New Democracy is a new social contract between the American people and leadership. New Democracy promises a politician that will work in his constituents’ interests through adversity, even through violence. Loyalty to your constituents will be rewarded until every man is a king."
 TEX_peoples_commission:0 "People's Commission"
 TEX_peoples_commission_desc:0 "Inspired by the judicial districts of Louisiana, the president has created a para-legal representative entity called the Peoples Commission.

 TEX_every_man_a_king:0 "Every Man a King"
 TEX_every_man_a_king_desc:0 "What began as a dream and lifted from a motivational book by Orison Swett Mardin, Every Man a King is now a political reality. It is positive thinking and the end of pessimistic greed that caused the Great Depression that will save America. Following Huey Long's economic and social plans to transform America and rewrite the political landscape."
 TEX_for_the_poor_man:0 "For the Poor Man"
 TEX_for_the_poor_man_desc:0 "Now the president has brought to Congress legislation to furnish a homestead allowance of 1/3rd the average wealth. A guaranteed annual income of $$2000 and old-age pensions is ready to be distributed to loyal Americans. Until such a time when the proper income tax changes are made, these benefits are coming out of the National Treasury."
 TEX_populist_education:0 "Education for the Masses"
 TEX_populist_education_desc:0 "Across this great nation there are millions more children struggling to resume normal life and facing a future no better than that of their parents without education. President Long has approved the bill Congress sped through to rebuild schools and reopen colleges for Americans in need."
 TEX_road_map_for_the_future:0 "Roadmap for the Future"
 TEX_road_map_for_the_future_desc:0 "The expenses the president has taken out for Every Man a King requires a fundamentally different means of tax collection and public financing to sustain itself. Therefore, President Long has laid out a road-map to plan out spending for the next four years of his term and milestones that America should cross."
 TEX_national_youth_adminstration:0 "National Youth Administration"
 TEX_national_youth_adminstration_desc:0 "The orphans of the Civil War need not only education to uplift themselves, but discipline as well. A visit to Boys Town near Omaha Nebraska has inspired President Long to create the National Youth Administration. A work training and activism group for young Americans that gives orphans a place to stay and trains them in important life skills."
 TEX_share_the_wealth:0 "Share the Wealth"
 TEX_share_the_wealth_desc:0 "It has come time for the rich that helped plunge America into civil war to pay. No person will be allowed to accumulate more than 300 times the annual income. Incomes are capped at $$1 million, and inheritances capped at $$5.1 million. President Long will prove the newspapers who decried him wrong."
 TEX_imperial_presidency:0 "Imperial Presidency"
 TEX_imperial_presidency_desc:0 "With traitors uprooted and exposed, public opinion polls show an overwhelming support for President Long's re-election. Unrestrained by pressure to conform or be threatened by members within the AFP, the president has begun what many are calling his 'imperial presidency'. The two-term limit is respectfully discarded until a lesser man is in charge."
 TEX_fire_with_fire:0 "Fight Fire with Fire"
 TEX_fire_with_fire_desc:0 "The ideological fight against the political and social enemies of America has been done thus far with welfare and incentives. Now President Long is ready to pull punches against the social resistance to Share the Wealth. We must use every measure possible to stop the boat of the nation from turning over."
 TEX_perfect_democracy:0 "Perfect Democracy"
 TEX_perfect_democracy_desc:0 "The original Constitution set out to create the perfect union in America. This union failed, America died, but through President Long it was saved.

### George Van Horn Moseley Path ###
 TEX_the_business_plot:0 "The Business Plot"
 TEX_the_business_plot_desc:0 "In order to keep the reputation of the War Powers Committee away from the public eye, we have chosen to extend the facade of the 'Arsenal of the Republic' into the new America. The saved United States will return to the fundamental values of our Founding Fathers, and clearly say to the world that America is a Republic, not a Democracy."
 TEX_use_the_fbi:0 "Use the FBI"
 TEX_use_the_fbi_desc:0 "J. Edgar Hoover understands the needs of the new American Republic to safeguard against traitors. The cooperation of the FBI is also popularly received as it signals stability. [TEX_use_the_fbi_text] If J. Edgar ever steps out of line, his relationship with Clyde Tolson will be public knowledge."
 TEX_alien_and_sedition_act:0 "New Alien and Sedition Acts"
 TEX_alien_and_sedition_act_desc:0 "One of the most important acts of the early American Republic was the Aliens and Sedition Act passed by President John Adams, a wise statesman. We must revive the Act to protect true Americans from syndicalist infiltrators. Firstly, being a danger to public safety or national integrity is now grounds for imprisonment and deportation."
 TEX_cointelpro:0 "COINTELPRO"
 TEX_cointelpro_desc:0 "The success of the New Aliens and Sedition Act has allowed us to identify several non-political and religious organisations with known syndicalist members. These groups will be monitored under the new COINTELPRO program, a the first fully empowered counterintelligence program capable of monitoring communications between group members."
 TEX_purge_dissidents:0 "Purge Dissidents"
 TEX_purge_dissidents_desc:0 "Through the Aliens and Sedition Act we have gathered a list of known enemies of the War Powers Committee. They are welfare Longists, anti-progress religious fundamentalists, and mutualists. We are prepared to arrest every ground member and have prepared to export certain as-of-yet untouchable politicians who support these dissidents."
 TEX_office_of_policy_coordination:0 "Office of Policy Coordination"
 TEX_office_of_policy_coordination_desc:0 "The Office of Policy Coordination, or OPC, was proposed as a means to influence local politics in our favour through agent provocateurs, small scale sanctions, and directly sabotage. The OPC will enable us to softly muscle out radicals and indignant federalists that wish to re-enter the US government on their terms."
 TEX_the_black_chamber:0 "The Black Chamber"
 TEX_the_black_chamber_desc:0 "Another safety objective is to revitalise the Black Chamber with something Vannevar Bush calls Memex. It is a hypothetical system that would be able to store and transmit microfilm and make information search-able from a station that is connected through telephone wire to other stations. This proposed plan could lead us to a golden age of security."
 TEX_american_nationalism:0 "American Nationalism"
 TEX_american_nationalism_desc:0 "The American Dream, or Creed, or even Ideal is the often-described glue that holds together our national integrity and prevents civil disturbances. The cascade of failure that was epitomised by Hoover and turned over by Huey Long is now fertile for our country to replant American Nationalism."
 TEX_the_american_legion:0 "The American Legion"
 TEX_the_american_legion_desc:0 "The end of Huey Long would have ended in disaster if not for the brave veterans of the American Legion. [TEX_american_legion_text] The American Legion should be empowered to prevent any traitors from threatening our Republic again."

 TEX_nationalize_boy_scouts:0 "Control the Boy Scouts"
 TEX_nationalize_boy_scouts_desc:0 "Patriotic youth organisations have existed in Europe for decades. Our own Boy Scouts of America are an untapped well of support for the country to encourage loyalty in Americans subtlety. The War Powers Committee authorises the appropriation of the Boy Scouts facility to educate and foster true Republicanism."
 TEX_fordism:0 "Fordism"
 TEX_fordism_desc:0 "Although scientific management was not invented by Henry Ford, it was Ford that proved that measuring time spent on work tasks could lead to faster and more efficient time management. To thank our Committee member Ford, we have granted him the intellectual property over the assembly line method, as well as promoted it in publications."
 TEX_american_capitalism1:0 "American Capitalism"
 TEX_american_capitalism1_desc:0 "Our country is a capitalist nation, and through the War Powers Committee we can revitalise the age of progress that dissidents and populists intended to destroy. Through our loyal Congressmen, Business Councils will be formed again in the Capitol, taxes will be lowered, and the stock market will be made safe from terrorism."
 TEX_capitalist_education:0 "Create the ESMWT"
 TEX_capitalist_education_desc:0 "The Engineering, Science, and Management War Training, or ESMWT, is the brainchild of the Department of Commerce to decentralise technological changes. Instead of cooperation that would disrupt competition and give an unfair advantage to certain businesses, this program disburses its findings freely to the public."
 TEX_captains_of_industry:0 "Captains of Industry"
 TEX_captains_of_industry_desc:0 "Without the noble self-sacrifice of the Captains of Industry, America would have been lost. We should push through Congress a new income tax bracket for those earning more than $$10 million dollars annually. With many exceptions designed to give these useful industrialists tax breaks if they are engaged in philanthropy."

 TEX_industrial_security_act_desc:0 "The need for work-site security has never been greater. The average working man is besieged by syndicalist infiltrators, Longist provocateurs, and federalist malcontents. We need to authorise the use of strikebreakers and integrate our loyal American Legionaries into the new National Guard so as to quickly respond to industrial sabotage."
 TEX_pass_nira:0 "National Labor Control Act"
 TEX_pass_nira_desc:0 "A permanent solution to the labour crisis has presented itself in the form of then executive order by [Root.GetLeader] to set up a National Labor Control Bureau.

 TEX_republic_without_democracy:0 "Republic without Democracy"
 TEX_republic_without_democracy_desc:0 "The American public is now in agreement that Huey Long's true vision of America was that of a Republic without Democracy. [TEX.GetLeader]'s term has been extended for another four years due to the continued emergency that threatens the American continent. Americanism as the War Powers Committee sees it grows as the term oligarchy loses its stigma."

 TEX_american_legion_lindbergh:0 "It was the American Legion under Lindbergh that rose to prevent Pelley from executing his wicked plans."
 TEX_american_legion_moseley:0 "It was the American Legion under Moseley that stood tall when public hysteria grew against syndicalists. It was also the American Legion that convinced Huey Long's Minutemen bodyguards to take that necessary detour."

 TEX_use_the_fbi_moseley:0 "We can trust the FBI to look in all the wrong places for Huey Long."

 TEX_traditional_values_lindbergh:0 "The press is mostly supportive of Lindbergh yet there is a minority that is wary of Lindbergh's anti-Semitism."
 TEX_traditional_values_moseley:0 "The press is divided between those that know [RootGetLeader] as an anti-semite canard and those who truly believe in America."

 TEX_red_scare_lindbergh:0 "After an announcement by the FBI that the Silver Legion has been sufficiently purged and can no longer threaten our Republic, the public has demanded that similar measures should be taken against Socialists to ensure that our Republic will never be in danger ever again."
 TEX_red_scare_moseley:0 "The FBI has announced that after many months of searching for President Long, he can no longer be presumed alive. The uproar against any socialist groups remaining in America is enormous. The War Powers Committee can barely keep up with all the state laws being passed to stop socialism."

### Pelley Path ###
 TEX_mine_have_seen_the_glory:0 "Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory"
 TEX_mine_have_seen_the_glory_desc:0 "It took many Americans by surprise to hear Huey Long's confession of being a syndicalist broadcast that night. The initial backlash could have ended the brief revolution had the Silver Legion faltered. Thankfully, the American Legion and Prohibition Party had deserted Long after his betrayal of his promises. This is the beginning of a new America."
 TEX_the_silver_legion:0 "The Silver Legion"
 TEX_the_silver_legion_desc:0 "The Silver Legion is currently the unofficial head of the American Legion, with propaganda delivered slowly through agents. This has led to pockets of dissent in some American Legion outposts. We must identify these dissidents and redistribute them to far flung outposts in order to minimise their potential."
 TEX_absorb_the_klan:0 "Absorb the Klan"
 TEX_absorb_the_klan_desc:0 "Hiram Wesley Evans has been officially inducted into the Silver Legion at a mass Klan gathering in the capital today. His word carries weight in the KKK and will be essential to reel in the Klan. We will also require that Klansmen no longer conceal their faces. In order to use the influence of members to the fullest extent."
 TEX_crackdown_on_traitors:0 "Crackdown on Traitors"
 TEX_crackdown_on_traitors_desc:0 "A group of stubborn Klansman that refuse to reveal their names have come to Pelley seeking exception. Our Chief Pelley made an enlightened decision to this issue, and has sent the Klansmen into a Secret Service. With a portion of the Klan still undercover, we will be able to seek out and eliminate those with reservations against us."
 TEX_covenant_sword_and_arm:0 "The Covenant, Sword, and Arm"
 TEX_covenant_sword_and_arm_desc:0 "Members of the Silver Legion in the White Identity Church of Jesus Christ-Christian have reported that many local financial institutions in their area are controlled by syndicalists and foreigners. Since the Legion is overstretched, our Chief Pelley has authorised the Church to appropriate wealth from citizens whether willing or not."
 TEX_camps_for_syndies:0 "Criminalise Syndicalism"
 TEX_camps_for_syndies_desc:0 "The future of Syndicalism and Longism has been decided. Labour re-education and internment camps are authorised by the shell Congress to house suspected syndicalists indefinitely until the national emergency of the Civil War has truly ended. The American Legion has already begun to clear meeting houses and city councils of traitors."
 TEX_forced_labor:0 "Forced Labour"
 TEX_forced_labor_desc:0 "The loss of one hundred thousand people from the labour market has angered what used to be loyal Legionaries. Debates in the once quiet halls of Congress are erupting to demand Pelley find a solution to the lack of able-bodied workers in America. Pelley's solution? Forced labour for traitors at the service of the corporation that is the Commonwealth."
 TEX_jim_crows_america:0 "Jim Crows America"
 TEX_jim_crows_america_desc:0 "The way of life in the South that the northerner Pelley found, that of segregation and state laws that prevented blacks from exercising civil rights, struck Pelley as the true soul of America. Finally, with total control and the world to gain by acting, Pelley has begun to suggest northern states pass Jim Crow laws of their own."
 TEX_protecting_our_race:0 "Revive Nativism"
 TEX_protecting_our_race_desc:0 "The foundations of America as Pelley and Armstrong see it are connected not only to the former nation of Britain, but to Anglo Saxons as a race. An executive act by Pelley has illegalised inter-racial marriage, requiring all marriages to occur in Christian Identity churches, and the Silver Legion itself has been deployed to re-segregate schools."
 TEX_segregation_forever:0 "Segregation Forever"
 TEX_segregation_forever_desc:0 "Our inability to stop protesters from returning each day despite the beatings and the bullets proved to be an intriguing challenge. The Silver Legion has decided to employ an overwhelming alliance to out-shout the dissidents by calling up segregationist organisations in the South and inviting them to the Capital."
 TEX_christian_commonwealth:0 "Christian Commonwealth"
 TEX_christian_commonwealth_desc:0 "Pelley's grand vision of the American Commonwealth is a country free of debt and bonds by turning the entire government into a gigantic corporation. Inalienable rights are given, not promised to native born Americans in the form of stocks that pay annual dividend or 'credits' to citizens that vote on their Silver Legion representative."
 TEX_white_welfare:0 "Common-wealth For Citizens"
 TEX_white_welfare_desc:0 "First order is to determine who is a true natural citizen and deserving of stock in the Common-wealth. They must be able to trace their ancestry to original voters at the time of the American Revolution, or have sworn a new oath the Silver Legion has prepared to dedicate their lives and they dynasty to Christians Identity forever."
 TEX_christian_education:0 "Christian Education"
 TEX_christian_education_desc:0 "Harvard's Divinity School should have been the gold standard for education since its inception. The education of Christians is essential to the Silver Legion's long life, and to do that we should fund divinity schools across the nation in the Harvard Model. Introspection into the secrets of Christianity will stop syndicalist thought."
 TEX_christian_identity:0 "Christian Identity"
 TEX_christian_identity_desc:0 "What began as an offshoot of Anglo-Israelism in Canada has grown into a concrete political and social doctrine under the Pelley-Armstrong line. Christian Identity envisions a union of German-Assyrians, Afro-Americans, Socialists, Jewish people, and Catholics that are all in a confederation against them. Now the public shall know of this danger."
 TEX_church_and_state:0 "Church and State"
 TEX_church_and_state_desc:0 "There are implicit religious values within America that only the Silver Legion can see. It is obvious to the Silver Legion and the Pelley-Armstrong line that America was meant to be ruled by only pious Protestant Christians. Therefore, Chief Pelley has recognised Christianity as the official religion of the American Commonwealth."
 TEX_christian_service_brigade:0 "Christian Service Brigade"
 TEX_christian_service_brigade_desc:0 "What began as a volunteer organisation for young boys during the Civil War has now become a nationally funded organisation, The Christian Service Brigade. Founder Joseph Coughlin was attracted to the Pelley-Armstrong line. Subsequent years have seen the group take in war orphans and given them a father figure in the Silver Legion."
 TEX_citzens_council:0 "White Citizens Council"
 TEX_citzens_council_desc:0 "The legacy of civil disobedience that shook the 1930s has stayed with the members of the White Citizens Council. The White Citizens Council has taken up the torch to intimidate voters and discourage citizen stockholders meetings from pushing for integration. Pelley has subtlety increased the common share of the White Citizens Council in response."
 TEX_christian_work_ethic:0 "Christian Work Ethic"
 TEX_christian_work_ethic_desc:0 "With the advent of the Commonwealth, there begins a split in work ethic across the nation that the Silver Legion did not intend. Blue Laws that used to allow Christian time off of work to go to church are being revoked as by those who do not value the morals of the nation. We must bring Blue Laws back."
 TEX_america_is_born_again:0 "America is Born Again"
 TEX_america_is_born_again_desc:0 "Many doubted the ability for the Silver Legion to succeed Huey Long, but those that took the risk are now enjoying the fruits of America's credit system and renewed faith. Huey Long's legacy is that of blindness and deception that gave way to Pelley's truth. What remains to be seen is what the foreign conspirators will do next."

### Reconstruction ###
 TEX_rebuilding_the_country:0 "Rebuilding the Country"
 TEX_rebuilding_the_country_desc:0 "A long struggle to push through the Federalist and Syndicalist forces in America has left the victorious Union State economically drained. The hand that unifies the country can either promote deficit spending regime, or an austere policy that limits direct intervention in the market."
 TEX_national_recovery:0 "National Recovery Administration"
 TEX_national_recovery_desc:0 "The NRA emphasises the use of public domain and work-living units instead of 'cut throat competition' of regular contract work. Workers in the NRA will receive the benefit of a minimum wages and price-controlled work environments in constant to the old Company Store model."
 TEX_public_works:0 "Public Works Administration"
 TEX_public_works_desc:0 "The ability to generate electricity, transport water, and ensure safe and efficient travel was lost during the civil war, but the Public Works Administration will fix all that. It is a fund that will ensure contractors pay their employees fairly."
 TEX_research_projects:0 "National Education Administration"
 TEX_research_projects_desc:0 "In the wake of the collapse of the CSA, the National Education Association has folded and its members dispersed. With most teachers being apolitical and the union never being able to exert much partisan power over them, it makes a strong candidate for rehabilitation by the new American government."
 TEX_civil_works_adminstration:0 "Civil Works Administration"
 TEX_civil_works_adminstration_desc:0 "As a nation, America lost a great deal of its labour supply to fighting and the poverty of the disorganised Federalists. The leader has pushed an executive order authorising the creation of an agency to employ manual labourers fill out the spaces in employment for NRA projects."
 TEX_the_ccc:0 "Civilian Conservation Corps"
 TEX_the_ccc_desc:0 "The damage done to America by the civil war has been considerable, and even approaching the idea of reconstruction seems like an insurmountable problem. An idea has been floating around the capital of establishing a public body to oversee not only the reconstruction effort but looking into how to rebuild a better America once that project is complete."
 TEX_rural_electrification:0 "Rural Electrification"
 TEX_rural_electrification_desc:0 "The electricity network throughout the country has regressed to that of the 1910s. This is Un-American and we need to ensure that our constituents can be properly informed about our nation's glory."
 TEX_the_aaa:0 "Agricultural Adjustment Act"
 TEX_the_aaa_desc:0 "Newspaper stories during the hysteria of '36 were filled with horror stories of farmers burning rotting crops due to being unable to sell excess while city ghettos starved. Our solution to this is the Agricultural Adjustment Act, to create a policy on crop conservation."
 TEX_farm_security_administration:0 "Farm Security Administration"
 TEX_farm_security_administration_desc:0 "Sharecroppers and tenant farmers make up a significant portion of our constituency, especially in the core power of the South. We must extend a credit program with very low interest rates to farmers who apply to resettle land, especially land in the old Steel Belt."
 TEX_begin_reconstruction:0 "Begin Reconstruction"
 TEX_begin_reconstruction_desc:0 "The civil war has blasted our country to pieces. Large parts of the rural country are naught but mud and ashes, while countless cities have been reduced to smouldering rubble. We shall set to work developing new housing and infrastructure as soon as possible."
 TEX_harsh_reconstruction:0 "Punish the Corrupt and Treacherous"
 TEX_harsh_reconstruction_desc:0 "Congress has sided with us in condemning these companies that betrayed the American people. Lists of majority shareholders in traitorous companies have been seized and the executive officers of companies that have exploited workers behind the facade of government are now on trial."
 TEX_reconciliation:0 "Reconciliation"
 TEX_reconciliation_desc:0 "Congress finally won out against the executive branch, and has decided not to bring charges against seditious companies. Executive officers were pressured to resign in order for their company to be re-listed however, but ultimately the shareholders are deemed innocent of wrongdoing."
 TEX_military_industrial_complex:0 "Military-Industrial Complex"
 TEX_military_industrial_complex_desc:0 "Constraints imposed by the poor state of the American treasury and the weak strength of the dollar has been made known to Congress, who has devised a new plan for recovery based on cooperation with private enterprise."
 TEX_coprotate_militarism:0 "Corporate Alliance"
 TEX_coprotate_militarism_desc:0 "The old bureaucratic system of time-based seniority pales in comparison to scientific management as proposed by Fredrick Taylor. We need the expertise of business professionals within Congress, in order to secure an alliance with the corporate infrastructure in America."
 TEX_business_subsides:0 "Loosen Regulations"
 TEX_business_subsides_desc:0 "The dual-layered federal government system had allowed for at times very loose regulations on workspace practice, depending on the state. In order to leverage this inherent balance in our government, we must allow businesses both large and small to thrive."
 TEX_building_grants:0 "Building Grants"
 TEX_building_grants_desc:0 "Smaller townships across America have no recourse if their need is slightly less than the threshold for contract work. Our remedy is a Building Grant program based off of the Ford Foundation. This allows communities to show proper need and return on investment for contract work."
 TEX_banking_act:0 "Corporate Militarism"
 TEX_banking_act_desc:0 "Many businesses closed or were temporarily forced to leave America when union activity reached a pitched frenzy. There must be a show of strength to prove that America is now safe. We shall offer surplus military goods to companies looking to relocate back into 'dangerous' areas."
 TEX_military_factories:0 "Military Factories"
 TEX_military_factories_desc:0 "Munitions factories and armouries are reporting a large loss of stock to theft as well as difficulty competing with foreign competition. We can fix the first without infringing on the Second Amendment with a tariff on imported arms."
 TEX_american_business_is_business:0 "American Business is Business"
 TEX_american_business_is_business_desc:0 "As most of Congress is fiscally conservative, it was easy to pass laws reorganising the newly named National Reserve to stop deflation. We must lower the money supply and remove illegal currency from circulation or else our buying power will never recover."
 TEX_create_esmwt:0 "Research Investments"
 TEX_create_esmwt_desc:0 "As we revitalise research labs and think tanks across the nation, we have also begun to spread highly rewarding research grants that have laid dormant during the Civil War. Privately funded or philanthropically created universities are given priority to receive grants from the government."
 TEX_reconstruction_is_over:0 "Reconstruction is Over"
 TEX_reconstruction_is_over_desc:0 "The course of reconstruction has revealed the true ideological basis for why Hoover was unable to fix the economy. The wiser constituents of these windbags have largely voted them out by now, as the GDP rises and the American standard of living rises and even exceeds pre-war levels."

 #TEX_increased_weapons_production:0 "Increased Weapons Production"
 #TEX_increased_weapons_production_desc:0 "An independent report published in the Houston Chronicle exposed poor working conditions as well as managers receiving kickbacks for underperforming. This is intolerable as loyalty to American values of hard work and rewarding wages is demanded."
 #TEX_rouse_the_people:0 "Rouse the People"

A group of concerned citizens, including hundreds of veterans and poor from Northern Louisiana have gathered in Baton Rouge, claiming that Earl Long has withheld their income and benefits. Governor Earl tried to speak to the crowd, claiming that the funds have yet to arrive from the capitol, and to disperse until that day. The protesters, many of whom were black veterans, began chanting for Earl's resignation. While accounts differ about what happened next, anywhere from 20-50 people lie dead among the protesters. It now lies with President Huey to pick up the pieces. Governor Earl is appealing to his brother to help him with damage control.

The book continues with the revelation that all the characters, both white and black, are mixed race, and the entire principle of racial supremacy collapses. While there were concerns that the book would be censored due to its veiled attacks against both white supremacists and black leaders, it appears that President [TEX.GetLeader] enjoys the book."

While America apparently mourns their leader's loss, the US governments in exile have continued their claims that Long's government is illegitimate."

### Business Plot Events 31 - 50 ###

 unionstate.31.t:0 "The Hollywood List"
 unionstate.31.d:0 "We know that Hollywood has always acted above the law. Its mere existence in California an attempt to dodge intellectual property laws. Moreover, it is no secret that some artists there had hoped for a syndicalist victory over our great American Republic. Their folly must be exposed and their sedition prosecuted."
 unionstate.31.a:0 "We'll film their trials."

 unionstate.32.t:0 "Persistence of Antisemitism"
 unionstate.32.d:0 "With the great success of Fordism in America, there comes as well some critics of the ideas presented in Ford literature. Especially within the Dearborn Independent, articles describing a massive worldwide conspiracy of Jews has created backlash against Fordism. The public at large is beginning to question Ford's ageing logic, and as Ford is not a very public man, his responses to the press have only damned him further. To Ford's critics, including other Committee members, racial rhetoric must be pushed subtly and anonymously. Most of the Committee including [TEX.GetLeader] still agree with Ford's theories, but disagree on the medium to propagate those ideas as to not destabilise the new America's international relations."

 unionstate.33.t:0 "Tying up Loose Ends"
 unionstate.33.d:0 "Weaving spiders are the many members of the press that continue their fruitless search for Huey Long. Although the FBI has made the best public display of effort possible, there persist some underground press who do not believe syndicalists did the deed. While most pamphlets on this are published anonymously, the FBI have traced their origin, and surprisingly found them to be coming from both the left and right, politically speaking. These conspiracy theorists, as we call them, could destabilise our new government if they continue their publications."

 unionstate.34.t:0 "Every Girl a Queen?"
 unionstate.34.d:0 "The most delicate part of the Business Plot is upon us. It appears Huey Long's will dictates that, in an event of his injury or incapacitation, his wife Rose Long was to take his post. Many die-hard Long followers have come to Washington, demanding Rose occupy the Presidential Mansion until Huey Long be found. They are met with an equal number of former Federalists who insist Huey Long's running mate, William Lemke, is the constitutionally-correct President. Siding with the constitution as our best defence is perhaps the more prudent path, though it could also be seen as an insult to Huey Long's widow and enflame the anger of the public even further."
 unionstate.34.a:0 "Make a public show of sympathy for Rose Long's cause."
 unionstate.34.b:0 "The Constitution is not subject to sentiment."

 unionstate.35.t:0 "But No One Wears A Crown"
 unionstate.35.d.coverup:0 "Finally the Business Plot's master stroke is ready: exhausting and unresolved debates have worn down the willpower of Congress to elect a Vice President with absolute majority. A group of our more trustworthy Senators are ready to bring George Moseley into his own as Vice President, and to then serve as President until Huey is found. This involves a very specific alteration to Article II and the 12th Amendment to allow for Moseley as President Pro Tempore to assume office. Any attempts to uncover the truth behind Huey's disappearance have gone nowhere."
 unionstate.35.d.uncovered:0 "Although he was maligned during the war for his almost nihilistic attitude, the journalist Westbrook Pegler has more than redeemed himself to the public today. Through investigative journalism, dodging government goons, and a dedication to facts over his own political reservations, the truth has been uncovered to the public. The underground press has exposed the true killers of Huey Long: his own bodyguards. The blood money was traced right back to none other than interim president, George Moseley. The whole apparatus of state has moved to arrest Moseley, who implicated the War Powers Committee in what people are calling the 'Business Plot'. These men will be brought to justice, wherever they lay."
 unionstate.35.d.scandal:0 "The Business Plot has succeeded, though it has come at great cost. Journalist Westbrook Pegler published an 'expose', accusing Moseley and others of conspiring to have Huey Long killed. Since its publication, Pegler's evidence has been proven flimsy and circumstantial - enough so that George Mosely was, in the end, considered more victim that perpetrator. The scandal has left a lingering taste among the public, but Moseley's allies in Congress were able to prevent any official hearings... and, after months of exhaustive and unresolved debates, have managed to arrange for him to serve as President until Huey is found. This involves a very specific alteration to Article II and the 12th Amendment, to allow for Moseley as President Pro Tempore to assume office."

Passed under Wilson in his vain populist bid to promote insurgent democracy over our Republican system of government. The 22nd Amendment will ensure that this unneeded alteration to our system is repaired and Congress will again be represented in the way the Founding Fathers intended."

 unionstate.37.t:0 "Patriotism or Profits"
 unionstate.37.d:0 "A conflict of interests has arisen between the market and the War Powers Committee. A recent speech given by Roger Babson highlighted the hypocrisy of multinational corporations that both claim to be patriotic while also opening factories in European syndicalist nations. Our own Fred Koch fired back by stating that the market and American people want their businesses to succeed as an extension of patriotism. While the War Powers Committee leads several multinational corporations, we have noticed a strong uptick in domestic sales that could remove the risk of retreating from foreign markets. It is time for the Committee to settle this national debate."

 unionstate.38.d:0 "Although the syndicalists are defeated and their members gone to ground, there still remains the threat of the union growth Huey Long foolishly promised. A proposal from Congress may be able to remedy this. The original American Plan was legislation proposed during the Wilson administration to guarantee employers ability to challenge Union activities. The foolish Congress under McAdoo failed to properly ensure this right, but the new American Republic will correct that. The American Plan will allow individual states to pass right-to-work laws and authorises the federal courts to prosecute union activity violating those laws."

 unionstate.39.t:0 "War Powers Committee vs Congress"
 unionstate.39.d:0 "A meeting today between the War Powers Committee and several congressmen friendly to our cause was held to address the future of representation in the Presidential Cabinet. Fear that the political spotlight the War Powers Committee is under by holding cabinet positions has two possible solutions: the first is to coordinate with Congress in order to push through a law to reorganise the Presidential Cabinet to officially become the War Powers Committee. The second is to appoint several of our loyalist politicians from Congress to appease prying eyes and keep the stability our new American Republic needs. The latter comes at great political cost, and will weaken our position, though certainly it goes a long way towards obscuring our intentions."
 unionstate.39.a:0 "The War Powers Committee will be the new cabinet."

 unionstate.40.t:0 "NAACP Declares the Government Illegitimate"
 unionstate.40.d:0 "In the wake of the devastating civil war, the future of African American rights fought so long for is again threatened. Initial assurances of civil protection by Huey Long kept many from the streets as socialists and federalists roiled. There were even planned meetings in New York City for Huey Long to directly address civil rights concerns before that fateful day. Now with Huey Long gone, all illusions of safety are dead. Walter Francis White, along with several high ranking members of the NAACP, have declared the new America illegitimate. Many of them now prepare to emigrate to Canada and to other countries as Marcus Garvey did and so many others did during slavery."

 unionstate.41.t:0 "Mothers Movement Clashes With Feminists"
 unionstate.41.d:0 "One of the least likely sources of support within the America First Party came from Mothers Movements. The Mothers Movements are a group of religiously-minded conservative women who aligned with the radical elements that sought to undermine Huey Long. Now that Huey is long gone, leaders like Alma Bridwell White and Elizabeth Dilling now direct hysteria against suspected socialists. Their marches have also demonstrated a xenophobia against Catholics and blacks. Their position within this new America is tenuous, as the highest members of our government regard the nineteenth amendment with only slightly more respect than the thirteenth through fifteenth."

 unionstate.42.d:0 "After a bout of illness and a delirium, President Moseley has died. In his final days in office, Moseley had refused every medical assistance, accusing every one he saw of being Jewish. The Vice President, Charles Lindbergh, was recalled to the capital to be sworn in. With the War Powers Committee in attendance, Charles Lindbergh was sworn in as the official 33rd President of the American Republic, as Moseley was only the interim President for his years in office. American expats have universally condemned the new President just as they did the old."

### Pelley Events ###

 unionstate.51.t:0 "Clare Hoffman causes Polio Outbreak"
 unionstate.51.d:0 "It began in the Meeting Halls of the Silver Legion, the idea that vaccines were a syndicalist plot to poison America. This, coupled with the belief that America's public water has been poisoned by fluoride, has propelled many a new politician into office - none higher than that of former Congressman Clare Hoffman, who has gained a following within the Silver Legion. This has even led to the AFP ending Dr. Maurice Brodie's promising polio vaccine research. Now the summer heat has brought with it the largest Polio outbreak in American history. Although Clare is out of office now and the American Public Health Association has been rehabilitated, the damage is still done. Many Americans are now permanently crippled."
 unionstate.51.a:0 "Polio must be stamped out."

 unionstate.52.t:0 "Fate of Murphy Ranch"
 unionstate.52.d:0 "Now that our Legion reaches from coast to coast, we must revisit our place of final resort Pelley had planned out. In the outskirts of L.A, this compound was built a ranch to sustain the Silver Legion in case of a syndicalist victory. Murphy Ranch, as it is called, now has the ability to become fully operational. Should we continue to fortify the homestead to protect our new Californian brothers? Or should we convert the land into a workplace for our reborn American industry?"
 unionstate.52.a:0 "Fortify it."
 unionstate.52.b:0 "Convert it."

 unionstate.53.t:0 "Can You See The Real Pelley?"
 unionstate.53.d:0 "Although only known to the highest-ranking members of The Silver Legion, there is a hidden depth in the mind of our Chief Pelley. To his closest friends, Pelley is more than a leader and a friend. He is their political, religious, and moral guide. Until now, a sort of secret doctrine has been hidden from the public at large due to their unwillingness to accept that religious and temporal authority are one and the same. Now that our enlightened leader is well-accepted in this brave new American society, should we go public with some of his more... esoteric ideas? Pelley's handlers, as it is, can barely keep him from exposing his deeper thoughts to the public at large. Is the mystery of Pelley enough for the history books?"
 unionstate.53.a:0 "Too many would fear this."
 unionstate.53.b:0 "The world is ready."

 unionstate.54.t:0 "Divergent Thinking in Christian Identity"
 unionstate.54.d:0 "Silver Legion representatives have done their best to screen for religious beliefs when recruiting, but our new recruits often propagate beliefs that do not fit the Pelley-Armstrong line. One group out in California called 'Mankind United' claims that America's Savior is their local minister. Another has insinuated the government is willing to assist Catholic nations in their liberation. The potential threat to our power is limited, but at the same time disunity breeds contempt. The Silver Legion leadership is divided as to whether these ideas are dangerous enough to stamp out. What are we to do about these outrageous claims?"
 unionstate.54.a:0 "Let the innocent lies rest."
 unionstate.54.b:0 "Wickedness must be stamped out."

 unionstate.55.t:0 "Rise of Speakeasies"
 unionstate.55.d:0 "Despite the overwhelming wave of approval Prohibition received within the loyal Christian community, there were some with reservations. In the cities and up high in the mountains, illegal alcohol production has been reported by our agents. The demon drink is being produced by these moral traitors and is transported overnight to underground bars across the nation. We must stop this affront against our values, and catch the deviants responsible."
 unionstate.55.a:0 "Alcoholism must be stamped out."

 unionstate.56.t:0 "Second only to The Chief"
 unionstate.56.d:0 "Our Chief Pelley was surprised when the Roman Catholic, Charles Coughlin, came into the Silver Legion offices to offer his services to The Commonwealth. His position has been tenuous since then, as our former Klansmen continue to monitor the publication of Social Justice. Today is different, however, now that his radio show's time slot has been taken by more important public services. His position as Chief Propagandist is effectively open. To whom should the post go to? To the very useful Herbert W Armstrong? To the loyal Richard Butler? or to an old America Firster Gerald K. Smith, whom has shown interest in turning Social Justice in to a real Christian publication."
 unionstate.56.a:0 "Armstrong the enlightened."
 unionstate.56.b:0 "Our loyal Butler."
 unionstate.56.c:0 "Smith, the Second Firster."

 unionstate.57.t:0 "The Great Lie"
 unionstate.57.d:0 "The official record in America has always been biased in favour of the ruling party. Once in office, Thomas Jefferson slandered the memory of the great patriot, John Adams, and fooled subsequent generations into believing his love for Nativism was tyranny. Now we must erase the great lie perpetrated by presidential candidate and Governor of Ohio, Warren G. Harding, to hide his black ancestry. We have the papers to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that Harding's father was a black man and therefore complicit in a worldwide conspiracy against the Commonwealth."
 unionstate.57.a:0 "Take that, Harding!"

 unionstate.58.t:0 "The Sound and the Fury"
 unionstate.58.d:0 "Today, famed author William Faulkner's seminal work 'The Sound and The Fury' released in theatres to critical acclaim. Most reviewers have praised the exaltation of the Compson family by the prodigal son, Jason. In the film, Jason sacrifices his hard-earned wealth to save his brother, Benjy, from a lifetime of pain, and saves his family's honour by sending his brother, Quentin, away to the barren North. Disaster strikes him when his niece, Miss Quentin, defrauds the family fortune and leaves town. Some critics have commented that the film is facetious and actually highlights the flaws in the Compson family and thus Southern society as a whole. Supporters of this interpretation cite author William Faulkner's liberal leanings, but those reviews were all published by known malcontents."
 unionstate.58.a:0 "I wrote better films than this!"

 unionstate.59.t:0 "Black Education Act"
 unionstate.59.d:0 "The wave of public education changes implemented by Pelley in order to solidify Christian Identity into the youth of America is nearly complete. His final act, which passed with unanimous approval by the shell of Congress, is the Black Education Act. The Black Education Act totally redefines education practices for ethnic minority communities and, in particular, African-Americans. Notably it focuses the education of African-Americans for their role as labourers and distances them from older notions of religious unity across races. As part of his speech announcing the law, Pelley stated, 'There is no place for the Negro in the Anglo Saxon community above the level of labourer. What is the use of teaching the Negro child mathematics, when it cannot use it in practice?'."
 unionstate.59.a:0 "Education that suits them."

 unionstate.60.t:0 "The Black Belt Act"
 unionstate.60.d:0 "One of the more controversial acts that Pelley is proposing is to extend the 1899 Indian Appropriations Act into the African-American community. The proposed Black Belt Act would make communities in the South with majority African-American populations into a reserved space with independent public services. At least on paper, the Silver Legion claims these areas will be administered by African-Americans under the regime's jurisdiction, similar to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Moreover the Act would strip citizenship and any previous common-wealth to African-Americans nationwide. However, there comes even from our loyal members murmurs that whites within the Black Belt would also lose their citizenship and rights. What shall become of this act?"
 unionstate.60.a:0 "Autonomy Now, Autonomy Forever."
 unionstate.60.b:0 "Not Now, Maybe Later."

 unionstate.61.t:0 "The Pass Laws"
 unionstate.61.d:0 "The Silver Legion has begun issuing a passbook to African-Americans throughout the Commonwealth in anticipation of the Pass Laws taking effect next year. This law is similar to older internal passport used during the time of the Confederacy to identify freemen and slaves. The Silver Legion strongly discourages any comparisons to past laws and has defended their claims with violence. This has resulted in numerous African-Americans being forbidden from traveling outside of the south with plans to extend zoning into the rest of the Commonwealth."
 unionstate.61.a:0 "Papers Please."

 unionstate.62.t:0 "The Penal Act"
 unionstate.62.d:0 "The Thirteenth Amendment made slavery illegal throughout the country. However, the Amendment allows for involuntary servitude as a punishment for crime. A new order passed by the shell Congress has increased the sentence time for moral crimes, and provided for more use of indentured labour in industry, thus being named the Penal Act. This Penal Labour has been given boost by reviving various Black Codes that criminalise attempting to vote as an African-American. The boisterous speeches Pelley delivers on the radio have tried to obfuscate the unfolding truth that slavery is back."
 unionstate.62.a:0 "Do your time."

 unionstate.63.t:0 "The Third Great Migration"
 unionstate.63.d:0 "Those thousands of African-Americans that left America before the civil war are being joined by hundreds of thousands more fleeing Pelley's terror. Groups like the International Labor Defence and the NAACP are now working together with the Red Cross to evacuate masses of people struggling to remain free. To the Silver Legion and their leaders, this plays into a long-standing fear of a united front against their rule. At the same time, the fewer the dissidents internally, the safer loyal Legionaries can sleep. The question is: what shall we do? Shall we let them leave, or shall we keep them here?"
 unionstate.63.a:0 "America is expelling toxins."

 unionstate.64.d.new_england:0 "A vast number of Americans, many of them African-Americans have fled into New England fleeing Pelley's goons. We have officially welcomed them as true Americans and more than a few are ready and willing to fight against Pelley."
 unionstate.64.d.liberia:0 "The thousands that arrived with Marcus Garvey in the early 1930s anticipated that more refugees would come. Even the strongest pessimist could not anticipate the overflow of refugees the Black Star Line has picked up and dropped off in Monrovia. Families are reunited, and the Grain Coast now swells with thousands more Americo Liberians. Those more concerned with food production however have noted that we can't really handle a growing population at this time."
 unionstate.64.d.mexico:0 "The existence of American refugees in Mexico has generally been ignored by the Central Government, as we have had amicable relations with America in the past. However, this Pelley is a threat to the entire continent, and the thousands more refugees crossing the Rio Grande tell of the Silver Legion's horrors. These refugees are far different from the Ambrose Bierce's' looking to retire, they are scarred and determined to end the Legionary regime of America."
 unionstate.64.d.haiti:0 "Haiti has always portrayed themselves as the second home for African-Americans. A common story to tell was that the first Haitian was a refugee of Ethiopia that ran with such force that he only stopped when he fell into Haiti. Now we see this again coming out of the USA. The sinister Pelley should not have the right to do this to American people! We feel the refugees outrage, at the same time we struggle to determine whether our fragile economy can handle a labour surplus of this magnitude."
 unionstate.64.d.cuba:0 "Just a 300 mile boat trip separated the thousands of American refugees from Cuba. Families in Cuba have been calling for months to their families to escape the very real threat of a nationalist takeover. None of them anticipated that the bottleneck in Florida would be opened all at once, causing hundreds of boats to show up at Varadero today. The flood of refugees from America has clogged up our ports, tied up or landlines, and put strain on the government ministry to respond. What should be our answer?"
 unionstate.64.d.hawaii:0 "An incredible amount of the Pacific separated us from the carnage in America, as well as the hand of that monster Pelley. We can only keep such good tabs on the so-called Commonwealth because trade with them is good, and now those trading ships have stowaways. These arrivals tell tales of burning towns and rampant pillaging by the Silver Legion that forced them to evacuate the continent to Hawaii. We may have issues handling the immigration process from a legal standpoint as well, so we must decide the fate of these American passengers."

Many of those bells were ringing in the ghettoes and reservations by the starving Americans hoping that Pelley's death would bring relief. These hopeful millions were scorned when the Vice Chief Gerald L.K. Smith announced at the funeral that he would serve as Chief in Pelley's stead until his Judgement Day. Despite this show of strength, American expats around the world cheer for the dictator's death and have pressed for condemnation of Chief Smith's continued Silver Legion regime in America."

The organisation's shareholders consist of members of the AFP, the Prohibition Party, and the Southern Tenant Farmers Union. These board members met at 2am, straddling the line between official business and secrecy. William Upshaw, of the Prohibition Party, brought to the fore President Long's apparent betrayal of his party values. The AFP board members agreed that Long's rejection of a main campaign promise bodes ill for more 'morally-centred' legislation in the future. Francis Townsend, who joined Huey Long in order to push his Old-Age Revolving Pension Plan, agreed it was necessary to elect a new representative for the Share Our Wealth program, someone who wouldn't be beholden to the president's whims. After much debate, it was decided that newly-elected Louisiana Congressman, Gerald L.K. Smith, is far enough removed from Long yet still dedicated to social security. As the votes were tallied in Smith's favour, the board pondered what Smith's association with the Silver Legion might mean in the future..."

Implicitly, these Democrats hoped Long would fulfil their desires for more state power in exchange for allowing Long's economic reforms to easily pass. This unwritten promise was broken when Long denied them the ability to enforce Prohibition, going so far as to ignore their impassioned speeches in favour of repealing the Interstate Commerce Act. Many conservative Democrats now see the AFP's regime as merely a sham democracy that rejects any measure the Long political machine will not personally benefit from. The President was still shocked, however, when the halls of Congress were only 3/4 full this week. Currently legislation is frozen, and it appears the so-called Dixiecrats are taking all their vacation days at once."

The press has reported these dissenting opinions, and thus have also given us warning of the officers' coming protest in the capital in five day's time. We have no illusions these marchers will be peaceful, or that their march won't culminate in a demand for the Silver Legion to return power to the AFP. General Patton, still leading the Fifth Army, has promised he will protect our right to rule the Commonwealth. Giving him free reign against the marchers, however, will be a bloody battle that could easily backfire on us. Richard Butler has suggested instead having Legion supporters infiltrate the marcher ranks and disrupt them from within. Better to make the officers look unreasonable and foolish than to make the government appear tyrannical."

The tedious process of replacing state representatives with Legionaries has meant that we have become more and more reliant on the Dixiecrats remaining content in the meantime. After a recent push by Chief Pelley to pass Amendments 22-24, bringing in a new "Grandfather" clause -depriving people of rights not enjoyed by their grandfather- and requiring a profession of faith in order to serve in Congress, the agenda has turned to Pelley's final amendment: reserving private and government land for redistribution to Christians. This has spawned a surprise backlash. The Dixiecrats claim this eminent domain impedes the rights of states to their own land, something Huey Long promised he wouldn't do. Chief Pelley is now in a bind. If he gives into the Dixiecrats, it will make him look weak at the very time he needs to look like he has all the answers. If he strongarms the amendment, as many of his advisers suggest, it dispels the illusion of democracy we so dearly need to maintain."

 unionstate.81.d:0 "Resentment against the Silver Legion outpost in Baltimore has been building for the past several weeks. After a poorly-written passion play performed to entice membership was mocked in the city's newspapers, Legion members have begun to feel isolated from the community, and have begun travelling in armed groups. Tensions rose, and the breaking point came when the Baltimore police came upon a Legionaire lynching - and attacked the Legionaries. A full-blown riot in the streets has resulted, and the entire situation has been subsequently mishandled by the Maryland National Guard, who appear to not know which side to take. If we intervene to take the Legionaries out of the fighting, our favouritism will be obvious and it will cost us. If we leave them in the riots, however, it not only threatens to turn into a national scandal but might also call into question our loyalty to the Silver Legion. Still, some are suggesting this betrayal of our own could save face with the public by providing us the appearance of neutrality."

During that time, no real evidence was found of the Silver Legion's involvement in the entire debacle, and though the Silver Legion's headquarters in Baltimore was breached as important documents were still being disposed of, none of those papers found their way into the hands of anyone who could do damage. The entire incident was reported on as an attempted syndicalist coup against the Pelley administration, with the ensuing public sympathy providing plenty of leeway for government action to be taken against figures of suspect loyalty. This windfall of support has emboldened Pelley, who claims he predicted the outcome as biblical fact. Pelley recalled Herbert W. Armstrong to the capital, and has now announced a second book detailing his further predictions for America based on his reading of the bible. The Silver Legion, under Pelley's leadership, hopes to fulfil the promises within this book in the coming years."

Public outrage spread rapidly, but thankfully enough work had already been done to ensure loyalty in and outside of the adminstration. For weeks, denials were issued, stern investigations made, and several scapegoats offered... until finally the worst of it was passed. The political backlash has still damaged the people's faith in the Commonwealth, but the Silver Legion has placed enough loyalists within positions of power that we are now secure. They cannot dislodge us."

The outraged public has rallied resistance to Pelley's administration, and it appears out job was not complete... the Silver Legion does not have enough loyalists in position to keep the government safe. The radio is alive with talk of rebellion. Desperate AFP members flock to the young Charles Lindbergh, who has taken command along with several Business Plot members now freed from death row and offered the country a lifeline to hold onto before it plunges once again into chaos."

The inevitable occurred, though we can perhaps be thankful that Patton was fired on first. An angry officer shouted 'traitor' and then fired, and as Patton fell his line immediately opened fire. Hundreds died on each side, but even the most unreasonable newspaper is hesitant to suggest afterwards that Patton's men were doing anything more than trying to maintain order in a chaotic situation. Patton succumbed to his injuries two days later, and has all but been declared a martyr in the continuing battle against public disorder in America."

The two proposals that caught the most interest are ones authored by Robert Goddard and Vannevar Bush, each proposing an expensive weapon project to deter invasions. Fortunately, both men were recovered from their respective hiding places, and persuaded into updating their proposals. Goddard's plan is for a liquid fuel rocket to deliver stable explosive payloads across long distances.

Therefore, Bush has had to resort to industrial technicians which extended the timeline. Finally, after much testing and assistance from George Kistiakowsky, the first atomic bomb is tested.

This declaration outlined the lack of protection the Federal Government gave to citizens, and the role of the state to protect the welfare of the poor.

After finishing a rigorous conditioning and training program started two weeks ago, a lottery was made to decide the jumping order of the experimental paradropping platoon made up of volunteers. When the Douglas C-33 took off from the Lawson Air Field and finally was put into position to start the experiment, Second Lieutenant William T. Ryder became the first American Paratrooper after making his jump and landing near Fort Benning. The second man, however, refused to jump, and so the first enlisted man to become a paratrooper was Pvt. William N. "Red" King, and then the remaining 8 platoon members in the aircraft. After their touchdown, they quickly reached the rendezvous point and completed their exercise goals, making the experiment a success."

While originally the high training standards and relatively high mortal risk initially caused few volunteers to show up, the high command authorised a triplication of the paratrooper wage as opposed to the foot soldier wage. Soon enough, the 501st Parachute Battalion was formed, quickly followed by other battalions and regiments. After a week recruitment, the number of volunteers was enough to form 5 paratrooper divisions for us to utilise. While these divisions still lack combat experience, this breakthrough in Airborne tactics should not be underestimated, and the High Command is looking forward to seeing their investment in these divisions pay off."

 TEX_GEORGE_MOSELEY_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L September 28, 1874, in Evanston, Illinois, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L George Van Horn Moseley graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1899 as a cavalry second lieutenant. He would serve in the Spanish American War commanding the 9th Cavalry Regiment where he even managed to achieve a major breakthrough against Ludovico Arejola, prompting a promotion to first lieutenant and a transfer to the 1st Cavalry Regiment. There he'd serve as Aide-de-Camp for Brigadier General J.M. Bell and J.M. Lee for the remainder of the campaign, fulfilling several staff roles in the rear. He'd be transferred back to the US in 1904, and would serve as a staff member of the Texas Headquarters, until being promoted to Captain in 1906. He'd continue to fill a variety of staff roles while at the same time attending the Army Staff College and the Army War College, of which he graduated in 1909 and 1911 respectively. He took part in Pershing's punitive expedition, providing logistical support to Pershing, and earning him the promotion to major. After commanding the Second Field Artillery Brigade, he was detailed as assistant to General Dawes in organising the Bureau of the Budget in 1921, after which he was promoted to Brigadier General for his remarkable performance. He'd become Executive Assistant to the Assistant Secretary of War and was put in charge of the Industrial Preparedness sector, which got him his promotion to Major General. In 1934 he had a major fall out with General MacArthur, and with the country's collapse into civil war, Moseley's first course of action was to leave the Federal Army and join the AUS Army in the south, where his experience and the lack of capable staff granted him an immediate promotion to Field Marshall by Huey Long.\n§YImportant Notes:§L- Has displayed strong anti-immigrant and anti-semitic views both publicly and privately.\n- Along with Charles Lindbergh, Moseley has been seen in frequent meetings with important businessmen from outside the military sphere, and his loyalty to Huey Long is proving to be dubious at best."
 TEX_GEORGE_PATTON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L November 11, 1885, in San Gabriel, California, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L George Smith Patton Jr., a fan of military history books from an early age, joined the Virginia Military Institute in 1903. In his second year, he was nominated for West Point, and while he performed excellently in the drill procedures at West Point, his academic performance was so bad that he was forced to repeat his first year. Despite all setbacks, he graduated as a cavalry second lieutenant in 1909 and was assigned with the 15th Cavalry Regiment. In 1912, his athletic skills made him the army's choice to represent the United States for the first modern Pentathlon in the Stockholm Olympic games, ranking fifth out of forty two participants. With the launching of the punitive expedition, Patton became Pershing's Aide-de-Camp during the largely unsuccessful expedition, but this strengthened ties between them and Patton became an almost permanent member of his staff and was promoted to Captain soon enough. He was promoted to Major in June 31, 1920 and began taking an interest in the Weltkrieg’s use of mechanised warfare. In 1923 he'd graduate from the Cavalry's Field Officer's Course, from the Command and General Staff College in 1924 and the Army War College in 1932. During the protests of the Bonus Army, Patton had a major falling out with MacArthur, after which Patton vocally opposed his colleague constantly, and he decided to leave to the AUS after his former CO, Fox Conner, convinced him that the AUS was the true american government, and that the Federal Government was bound to fail if decisive action wasn't taken. With his reputation preceding him, Huey Long decided to skip the rank of general and name Patton an outright Field Marshall, a role which Patton claims to be more than prepared to fulfil.\n§YImportant Notes:§L- While publicly his loyalty remains unquestioned, his former friendship with Dwight Eisenhower make many members of the staff distrustful of Patton\n- Has displayed strong racist views in public."
 TEX_CLAIRE_LEE_CHENNAULT_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L September 6, 1890, in Commerce, Texas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L Claire Lee 'Old Leatherface' Chennault began his military career when he joined the Reserve Officers' Training Corps while he attended the Louisiana State University. He graduated from the Officers' School at Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indiana in 1917, and was transferred to the Aviation Division of the Army Signal Corps soon after. He earned his wings in 1919 and remained in service after the air branch was turned into the Air Corps. In 1931, he became Chief of Pursuit Section at Air Corps Tactical School, and would take charge of the 1st Pursuit Group of Alabama's Aerobatic Team, becoming a regional celebrity of his aerial feats. As 1937 loomed over, Chennault was considering resignation as the staff in Washington refused to promote him beyond Captain, considering him unfit for duty due to his declining health. When the American Civil War began, Chennault sided with the former Governor of Louisiana, giving Huey a small hike in recruitment as passionate observers of Chennault's performances filled the recruiting booths, and in exchange, Huey granted Chennault the honorary rank of Brigadier General for his service to the American Union State\n§YImportant Notes:§L- His health has been slowly deteriorating, with deafness and chronic bronchitis being the main issues Chennault will have to face sooner or later."

He'd stay as a teacher in West Point and marry Gladys Easterbrook in his time at the academy. In 1921, he began teaching Chemistry in West Point as well and in 1926, he graduated from the company officer course at the Infantry School in Fort Benning. A year later, he'd undergo and successfully complete an advanced course at the Field Artillery School at Fort Sill. After that, Collins taught weapons and tactics at the Infantry School from 1927 to 1932 where he requested a transfer to the Philippine Division from 1933 to 1934 and became a major. In 1935 and 1936, he graduated from Army Industrial College and the Army War College reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel. With the outbreak of the Civil War, Collins aligned with Patton within the army, and both chose to leave southwards to join Huey Long's forces. When Patton was nominated as Field Marshall by Huey Long himself, Patton requested the promotion of Collins to Brigadier General which was granted by the Southern Demagogue.\n§YImportant Notes:§L- An extremely talented yet aggressive commanding officer, his skills shine the most when leading an attack on the enemy rather than playing on the defence."
 TEX_COURTNEY_HODGES_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L 05 January, 1887, in Houston County, Georgia, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L Courtney Hicks Hodges began his military career when he joined West Point in 1904, but was forced to drop out a year later due to his extremely poor academic performance. Undeterred, he enlisted in the army in 1906 as a private, where he quickly rose to the rank of sergeant in 1907 and earned a commission as a second lieutenant in 1909. He joined Pershing during the Punitive Expedition, where he met George S. Patton and George Marshall, and would remain in the Mexican border for the rest of the late 1910s, facing off several small skirmisher groups with the 6th Infantry Regiment. After being promoted to Major for his service at the border, he attended the Command and General Staff College, graduating in 1925 and becoming a member of the Infantry Board at Fort Benning. In 1934, graduated from the Army War College, earning him his promotion to lieutenant colonel. With Patton and Marshall vocally opposing MacArthur, Hodges was forced to choose between either one of his friends in case the situation deteriorated. He chose the former, as Patton managed to sway Hodges into joining him in the AUS Army, where the now Field Marshal Patton has offered his friend Hodges an early promotion to Brigadier General."

Soon afterwards the regiment was sent overseas to Mindanao, in the Philippines, in January 1910 and remained there for another two-and-a-half years, where Simpson participated in the suppression of the Moro Rebellion. He returned to the United States with his regiment in 1912 and, being stationed at Fort Bliss, remained there as a company commander until, now promoted to first lieutenant, he fought in Pershing's Punitive Expedition in 1916. In February 1917 he became aide-de-camp to Major General George Bell, Jr., who commanded the El Paso Military District. Since 1919, Simpson has filled several staff appointments and attended military schools and courses and would be promoted in early 1921 to Captain. Simpson served with the General Staff until 1932 where he began teaching military science and tactics at Pomona College until 1936, being promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1934. As the country spiralled out of control, Simpson became more and more aligned with Huey Long's vision of America as time passed, and when Huey finally proclaimed the American Union State, Simpson presented his services to what he sees as the true American government. For his loyalty, Simpson was turned into a brigadier general."

Devers' first posting was to the 1st Battalion, 4th Mountain Artillery in Washington and for his next assignment in late 1912, Devers was sent back to West Point to teach mathematics. On 1 April 1916, he was promoted to first lieutenant and he was transferred to the newly activated 9th Field Artillery at the Schofield Barracks in Hawaii and promoted to Captain in early 1917. In May 1919, Devers was sent on a three-month temporary duty assignment to study the Weltkrieg in Europe. He attended the Preußische Kriegsakademie in Berlin to study the equipment and tactics used by both sides during the Weltkrieg. He was promoted to major on 1920 and he was later selected to attend the Command and General Staff School, graduating in 1925. He was then posted to Fort Sill as the director the Field Artillery School's Gunnery Department until 31 August 1929 where Devers was transferred to Washington, D.C., to serve on the staff of the Chief of Field Artillery. In 1932, he was chosen to attend the Army War College and graduated on June 1933. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 26 February 1934. With the country spiralling into Civil War, Devers found himself fighting more and more against his superiors inability to react to internal issues, starting a deep rivalry between him and Dwight Eisenhower, even putting him at odds with his old friend Leslie McNair. When Huey Long declared the Union State, Devers decided that MacArthur and his staff was a liability for America, and promptly volunteered for the AUS officer corp, where he was promoted to Field Marshall along with George Patton."

He'd be posted mostly in garrison duties throughout Texas, where the only exceptions where when he took part in the Veracruz Expedition, and taking part in the border patrols along the Mexican border, where he befriended Dwight Eisenhower. After 1920, Walker served as an instructor at Fort Benning, Georgia and underwent further tactical training by the Army, attending the Command and General Staff School in 1925 and graduating in 1926 as a lieutenant colonel. He'd be moved to the American Legation in Tianjin in 1930, and would return to America in 1933 to sign up for the Army War College, where he graduated in mid-1936.

With the ever increasing radicalisation, he found himself being harassed several times by 'workers' militias' and slowly began losing faith in the Federal Government.
