 PSA_last_bastion_of_american_democracy_desc:0 "America has fallen into chaos. Split into all sides among radicals and reactionaries, we shall regroup and build upon the west coast. With patience and fortitude, we will emerge victoriously. Like our forefathers who fought to keep the union, so shall we once again unite this dear country of liberty from falling into permanent anarchy."

 PSA_deWitt_plan_idea_desc:0 "With the approval of the new national congress and the appointment of John L. DeWitt as Chief of Staff of the Western Defence Command, we're now preparing for a long war with the objective of securing our holdings after each advance instead of trying to achieve a quick victory."
 PSA_Marshall_plan_idea:0 "Marshall Plan"
 PSA_Marshall_plan_idea_desc:0 "With the approval of the new national congress and the appointment of John C. Marshall as Chief of Staff of the Western Defence Command, we're now preparing for a fast war with the objective of knocking out the enemy before we get bogged down on the West behind the Rockies. As Marshall puts it, he believes we will have no chances of success once any one of the enemy factions manages to seize the East Coast and the Midwest in its entirety, and failure to act fast enough will lead to our defeat."
 PSA_the_big_push_westwards:0 "Operation Glacier"
 PSA_the_big_push_westwards_desc:0 "After months of preparations and logistical planning, Operation Glacier has begun with the objective to cross the Rockies and take as much land as possible in order to prevent a possible enemy victory."
 PSA_military_industrial_production_1:0 "Military Industrial Production"
 PSA_military_industrial_production_1_desc:0 "With many of the national weapons factories being in the control of our enemies, we are forced to draft new contracts with our local enterprises in order to cope with the demand for our army. Luckily for us, plenty of factories in our territory have joined our cause and are more than capable of improving production if the right incentives are given. By redirecting funding from other sectors, we can provide said incentives to these companies and make sure our men stand ready and equipped for war."
 PSA_military_industrial_production_3:0 "Military Industrial Production"
 PSA_military_industrial_production_3_desc:0 "With our resounding victory in the civil war, we now count with a formidable military industrial complex. While normally in peace time, this would be time to start redirecting our funding back to civilian uses, storm clouds gather worldwide, and our mighty nation may yet again become embroiled in war. As such, an expansion of the contracts we signed and an increase of our funding to the military sector will help us be prepared for when the next conflict comes knocking."

 PSA_failed_operation_liberty:0 "Aftermath of Operation Glacier"
 PSA_failed_operation_liberty_desc:0 "With the failure of Operation Glacier, general defeatism has taken hold of most of our Army, and the civilian populace grows unsettled at the result of such a costly operation. While the morale is low, many lessons have been learned at the front line, lessons which the High Command is sure to utilise to try and bring about a new plan that may yet save our nation from radicalism."

 PSA_Operation_Liberty_mission_desc:0 "With the Civil War raging on the other side of the Rockies, the Western Defence Command High Staff has decided that, in order to win the war, a decisive strike to reach the Great Plains should be achieved. Commander in Chief Marshall has assured us that victory will be within reach if we manage to achieve our goals. However, failure to achieve these goals would undermine morale, and perhaps set us on the path for total defeat..."

 PSA_join_japan:0 "Align with Japan"
 PSA_join_japan_desc:0 "The great Pacific is not the only thing we share with the Japanese, for they have shown themselves to uphold the same values of democracy that we hold so dear. After they aided us in the Civil War, it would be only just for us to join the Japanese in their goal of spreading stability, democracy and liberty in the Pacific."

### Army Focuses ###
 PSA_activate_the_Western_Defense_Command:0 "Create the Western Defence Command"
 PSA_activate_the_Western_Defense_Command_desc:0 "Since we claim to be the real America, and our Army is officially the United States Army, the command hierarchy remains unclear on many levels. As such, we will push for the creation of the Western Defence Command, an apparent detachment of the Army which will work independently, and will reunite with the Army in structure once the civil war is won."
 PSA_prepare_the_artillery:0 "Prepare the Artillery"
 PSA_prepare_the_artillery_desc:0 "The indisputable winner of the Weltkrieg was Artillery. With it, our army may advance over a suppressed enemy, as well as stop any enemy offensive dead in its tracks. As such, our immediate priority will be to repurpose the Navy's spare cannons to the artillery branch, as well as fund the development of new artillery models and improved artillery parts to facilitate mass production of this deadly weapon."
 PSA_joint_chiefs_of_staff:0 "Joint Chiefs of Staff"
 PSA_joint_chiefs_of_staff_desc:0 "The creation of a high command able to coordinate army, air, and naval efforts is needed to win this war, and keep our military up to date with modern theoretical standards."
 PSA_defense_logistics_agency:0 "Defence Logistics Agency"
 PSA_defense_logistics_agency_desc:0 "America is an enormous country, full of varied terrain. We need to create a centralised logistics board able to coordinate warfare across the varied biomes of America."
 PSA_deWitt_in_Charge:0 "CIC: John Lesesne DeWitt"
 PSA_deWitt_in_Charge_desc:0 "Major General John Lesesne DeWitt, unlike many members of the staff who advocate for us to aggressively assault the enemy positions, has proposed for us to focus on more careful advances with powerful consolidations. In his view, slow and steady advances paired up with a centralised high command will see our nation through this civil war. With him as Commander in Chief, America shall be free once again!"
 PSA_Marshall_in_command:0 "CIC: George Catlett Marshall"
 PSA_Marshall_in_command_desc:0 "Brigadier General George Catlett Marshall, has come to us with a damning prediction: If the West Coast fails to cross the Rockies and secure a foothold in the Midwest, then defeat will be assured. In his view, a quick advance through the Rockies with the help of motorised elements will be what see us through this civil war. With him as Commander in Chief, America shall be free once again!"
 PSA_protecting_Columbia:0 "Protecting Columbia"
 PSA_protecting_Columbia_desc:0 "The Army War College, the Field Artillery School, Fort Benning and many other major buildings, locations and training sites have been damaged by the war, and their reconstruction should be one of our top priorities to bring the Army back on its feet now that the civil war is over."
 PSA_military_research:0 "Military Research"
 PSA_military_research_desc:0 "While we have some of the finest universities and thinkers in the world, we cannot research everything at once. We need to pick a direction for our military research to focus in."
 PSA_weapon_designs:0 "New Weapon Designs"
 PSA_weapon_designs_desc:0 "While the M1 Garand managed to see us through the Civil War, its flaws were as noticeable when it was adopted as they are now. However, with the criticism we have gathered during the civil war, we have contacted the original designer, and he has assured us that by redesigning the barrel, gas cylinder, and front sight assembly, he will make the Garand an even more reliable and deadly weapon."
 PSA_Army_rangers:0 "Army Rangers"
 PSA_Army_rangers_desc:0 "An elite group of specialised soldiers, the Army Rangers will be able to carry out covert missions in rough terrain, disrupting enemy supply lines and morale."
 PSA_90_division_Army:0 "90-Division Army Plan"
 PSA_90_division_Army_desc:0 "While Marshall originally envisioned that a reformed US Army would require a 265-Division Plan to be fully mobilised, the limitations of the West Coast make such a plan a pipe dream. As such, he has decided to adopt a 90-Division Plan, with the objective of raising a total of at least 90 divisions against America's enemies."
 PSA_motorization:0 "Motorisation Program"
 PSA_motorization_desc:0 "With the original rejection of the motorisation plans, a ghost has loomed the American Army as their methods became backwards as opposed to other militaries. Marshall has now proposed the government to subsidise truck production and to being the seizure of civilian trucks for the creation of motorised units capable of crossing the American countryside before our enemy can react."
 PSA_tank_production:0 "Increase Tank Production"
 PSA_tank_production_desc:0 "With the West Coast's low manpower, the High Command has had to design a plan to effectively improve what every man is worth in the field. In any of those plans, expanding Tank production in the West Coast comes as a priority, as their relatively low manpower cost and high combat effectiveness proves that it will not only save us lives, but also helps us push the enemy back more swiftly."
 PSA_Officer_instruction:0 "Officer Instruction"
 PSA_Officer_instruction_desc:0 "Marshall has presented this issue to our government, and his solution is to create forward study-bases, with more experienced officers mentoring younger ones in tactics. While this may put more of our officers in the line of fire, it will also ensure our new generation of officers gets first hand experience, as well as improving our army's leadership on the lower echelons as a whole."
 PSA_recon_units:0 "Reconnaissance Units"
 PSA_recon_units_desc:0 "Knowledge is Power, and Marshall believes that without the former two, victory in America will be impossible. We are outmanned and outgunned by our enemies, but if we know their every movement, then we can nullify our enemy's superiority by out-witting them."
 PSA_one_switft_push:0 "Start Operation Glacier"
 PSA_one_switft_push_desc:0 "'The Object of Operation Glacier is to secure a lodgement area on the Midwest from which further offensive operations can be developed. The lodgement area must contain sufficient infrastructural support to maintain a force of at least fifteen divisions across the Rockies, preferably double that amount, and that also enable that force to be augmented by reinforcements from the West Coast area(...)'"
 PSA_defense_is_the_best_offense:0 "Defence is the Best Offence"
 PSA_defense_is_the_best_offense_desc:0 "The First step towards preparing for the coming storm will be to improve our defence construction. Trench digging and fortifications construction will be a basic part of our army's curriculum, so that when the enemy waves come and threaten our home, we shall prevail."
 PSA_logistic_security:0 "Logistical Security"
 PSA_logistic_security_desc:0 "Logistics are a not-so well known battlefield which will be vital for us if we wish to gain the upper hand against the radicals in the East. Investing into new munitions factories to keep our men fighting as well as funding our logistical corps should go a long way into helping us achieve this goal."
 PSA_Expand_the_Presidio:0 "Expand the Presidio of San Francisco"
 PSA_Expand_the_Presidio_desc:0 "The Presidio of San Francisco has a long tradition of being vital for our nation's war efforts since America occupied it in 1846. As it stands, it is the most logical seat of power to direct our army's efforts, as well as the best prepared facility in the West Coast to hold the Command Staff. However, being the best prepared facility the region doesn't mean it's up to standard, and an expansion of the Fort is required."
 PSA_improve_bite_and_hold_tactics:0 "Improve 'Bite and Hold' Tactics"
 PSA_improve_bite_and_hold_tactics_desc:0 "The 'Bite and Hold' tactic was first adopted by the British during the Weltkrieg, and as the tactic, while costly, proved to be a resounding success, now more than ever we need to look at its success and analyse how we can improve it so that we may have the best attack and consolidation tactics America has to offer."
 PSA_engineer_corps_expansion:0 "Expand the Engineer Corps"
 PSA_engineer_corps_expansion_desc:0 "America has some of the largest rivers in the world, including the Mississippi, Rio Grande, and the Colorado. We should ensure our engineers have the proper tools required to build fording equipment and other field fortifications."
 PSA_coast_to_coast_planning:0 "'Coast-to-Coast' Planning Board"
 PSA_coast_to_coast_planning_desc:0 "With the Expanded Presidio, DeWitt has proposed the creation of a Planning board, capable of issuing new and adaptable plans for our front line commanders so that we may push our enemies from sea to shining sea."
 PSA_increase_military_spending:0 "Increase Military Spending"
 PSA_increase_military_spending_desc:0 "The Civil War devastated the American Civilian industry, but has made the Military Industry quite a profitable enterprise. While the Civil war may be over, America still has enemies to fight and wars to win, and as such keeping the Civil War military spending and expanding upon it is on our best interests."
 PSA_bring_the_complex_west:0 "Rebuild the Military Industrial Complex"
 PSA_bring_the_complex_west_desc:0 "With most of the Military Industrial Complex in the East, the Civil War has devastated the old munitions and weapons factories that made up America's war industry as they became high value targets for bombings and a preferred hiding spot of persistent enemy defenders. If we wish to be ready for the next war, investing into rebuilding the military industrial complex is one of our priorities."
 PSA_Columbia_needs_you:0 "Columbia Needs You!"
 PSA_Columbia_needs_you_desc:0 "The Figure of Columbia, a woman wearing an American flag gown and a Phrygian hat, is the personification of the ideals of freedom and pursuit of liberty we fought so hard to achieve. With the tyrant overthrown and the radicals put down, the service of the American people to Columbia is not yet over. War looms in the horizon, and only the brave men of America can protect her and our nation from tyranny."
 PSA_defense_contracts:0 "Defence Contractors"
 PSA_defense_contracts_desc:0 "Unlike some command-style economies in Europe, we must rely on contractors to produce our weapons. Ensuring these companies are prepared for this new Civil War should be a top priority."
 PSA_crossing_the_rockies:0 "Crossing the Rocky Mountains"
 PSA_crossing_the_rockies_desc:0 "The Rocky Mountains is a formidable geographic formation that separates our beloved West Coast from the carnage in the East. However, with our fate being to reclaim the rest of America, we will have to cross the Rocky mountains eventually and face our enemies. As such, we should begin preparations for a smoother campaign through them."
 PSA_gi_bill:0 "The G.I. Bill"
 PSA_gi_bill_desc:0 "Massive numbers of demobilised servicemen will be a major issue in the aftermath of the Civil War. We should create education and job training programs to better re-integrate them into civilian life."
 PSA_war_bonds:0 "War Bonds"
 PSA_war_bonds_desc:0 "We need adequate funding to properly fight this war. Bonds are a popular way of fundraising, and we can easily promote them through cartoons, films, and other popular mediums."
 PSA_walkie_talkies:0 "Walkie-Talkies"
 PSA_walkie_talkies_desc:0 "Portable radios, or 'Walkie-Talkies' as they are commonly called, present a powerful tool for our army. With them, our troops can coordinate artillery and air strikes, among other things."

### Navy Focuses ###
 PSA_navy:0 "U.S. Navy"
 PSA_navy_desc:0 "The American navy was once the pride of the world. Yet much of it deserted to the traitors to the east. We should review what forces stayed loyal to our government, so we can best determine how they can serve in this war."
 PSA_great_white_fleet:0 "Great White Fleet"
 PSA_great_white_fleet_desc:0 "The Great White Fleet was the height to American naval power. We should look back at it for inspiration. A great fleet of battleships and dreadnoughts will ensure we always have naval superiority."
 PSA_protect_american_trade:0 "Protect American Trade"
 PSA_protect_american_trade_desc:0 "Trade is the lifeblood of America. We should focus our naval doctrine on making sure that it is protected from enemy raids."

 PSA_light_cruisers:0 "Light Cruiser Development"

 PSA_naval_aviation:0 "Naval Aviation"
 PSA_naval_aviation_desc:0 "Naval aviation is the future of warfare on the high seas. We should ensure that our air designs are capable of being launched from carriers and destroying the enemy fleet without even endangering our own."
 PSA_expand_dockyards:0 "Expand Dockyards"
 PSA_expand_dockyards_desc:0 "Our dockyards are somewhat inadequate to fight a war on their own. We need to ensure that new naval production facilities are constructed to support the war effort."
 PSA_submarines:0 "Submarine Development"
 PSA_submarines_desc:0 "Submarines allow us to wreak havoc on enemy shipping and heavy ships. We should ensure that our designs stay up to date against enemy destroyers and anti-submarine tactics."
 PSA_liberty_ships:0 "Liberty Ships"

 PSA_maratime_industry:0 "Maritime Industry"

 PSA_new_admirals:0 "New Admirals"

### Air Force Focuses ###
 PSA_Create_The_USAF:0 "Create the USAF"
 PSA_Create_The_USAF_desc:0 "Before the war, the American Army Air Corps was, as its name suggests, little more than a branch of the Army. In this new war, we need to ensure it is independent and gets the support it needs."

 PSA_Re_Establish_The_ACTS:0 "Re-establish the ACTS"
 PSA_Re_Establish_The_ACTS_desc:0 "The Air Force Tactical School was the officer training school for the old Army Air Corps. Given the results of the civil war, it is clear that we must rebuild the ACTS in order to better prepare our air forces."

 PSA_Expand_The_WASPs:0 "Expand the WASPs"

 PSA_The_Screaming_Eagles:0 "The Screaming Eagles"
 PSA_The_Screaming_Eagles_desc:0 "Airborne divisions are a new development in warfare, but one that promises to hold significant bonuses. We should investigate creating our own airborne units."

 PSA_Airfield_Expansion:0 "Airfield Expansion"
 PSA_Airfield_Expansion_desc:0 "The range of our fighters and bombers are limited by the airfields to which they are attached. By improving both the quality and quantity of these airfields, we will be able to strike more targets more frequently."

 PSA_New_Fighter_Models:0 "New Fighter Models"

 PSA_Naval_Support:0 "Naval Support"
 PSA_Naval_Support_desc:0 "Our navy is not invulnerable, and there is a genuine concern that they might not be able to win every high seas battle that they need to win. By investing in some naval bombers, we can even the odds by striking any hostile ships in range of our air bases."

 PSA_RADAR:0 "R.A.D.A.R."

 PSA_Long_Range_Interceptors:0 "Long Range Interceptors"
 PSA_Long_Range_Interceptors_desc:0 "While having better bombers is vital to win the war of tomorrow at the enemy's doorstep, these bombers can seldom operate on their own. They will need an escort capable of facing off enemy fighters and come back in one piece. Luckily for us, plane designer Kelly Johnson has contacted us with a new and innovative design: The P-38, dubbed 'The Lightning'."

 PSA_Strategic_Bomber_Development:0 "Strategic Bomber Development"
 #Intentionally playing up 'The Bomber Always Gets Through' here.:
 PSA_Strategic_Bomber_Development_desc:0 "Tactical bombers are all well and good for supporting the men on the ground, but the true potential of bombers lies in Strategic Bombers. When they get through, enemy cities and industry are left in ruins, and the will of the enemy to continue the war is shattered. A large fleet of strategic bombers will make us very powerful."

 PSA_Strategic_Disruption:0 "Strategic Disruption"
 #We are as dwarves seated upon the shoulders of giants.:
 PSA_Strategic_Disruption_desc:0 "Now that we have the bombers we need, we must develop theories and training to make the best use of them.

 PSA_support_business:0 "Support Businesses"
 PSA_support_business_desc:0 "While the unchecked capitalist excesses of the Republican party are a step too far, we still must ensure that businesses have the proper support from the government. Anti-syndicalist regulations are a key step on this path."

 PSA_immigration_act:0 "Immigration Act"
 PSA_immigration_act_desc:0 "While some may say immigration is the backbone of our country, we have more pressing concerns then letting more people into our destroyed country. Rebuilding our once-great country should take precedence."
 PSA_hays_code:0 "Hay's Code"
 PSA_hays_code_desc:0 "While everyone enjoys a good film now and then, the unchecked moral excesses of Hollywood need to be clamped down on. A strict code of conduct for actors and producers is required to avoid the spread of syndicalist messaging in films."

 pacificstates.50.d:0 "It has been proposed that Congress create a committee dedicated to dealing with subversive elements within our society, those that fought against the government. This Committee shall be known as the House Un-American Activities Committee and be dedicated to stamping out traitors to America.

 pacificstates.51.t:0 "Hay's Code and Movies"
 pacificstates.51.d:0 "Hollywood has decided to create the so called Hay's Code, named after Will H. Hays, leader of the motion picture association of America. The stated goal of this legislation is to ensure 'morality' in film, though many see it as a way to subvert syndicalist themes in films. Its effectiveness may be somewhat dubious, however, as a number of directors have shown great pleasure in skirting as close to the rules of the code as possible without breaking it."

During the Wilson and McAdoo administrations the Klan experienced a major rebirth and then decided to join the would-be tyrant Huey Long.

 pacificstates.62.t:0 "The Immigration Debate"
 pacificstates.62.d:0 "The situation the Federal Government arrived at when the Pacific States was created did not offer us time to clarify the policy of immigration. This meant that a deal being planned by the Department of Labor to allow for Mexican labour temporary work rights in the United States was frozen for a time. Now that elections have been held and Democrat power retained, we can now address this concern. This program proposed by the Department of Labor was meant to alleviate the west's employment shortage and was supported by the Republicans. Now traditionally our party line is to respect the Alien Exclusion act and the rights of natural born American workers to determine the direction of the economy, but our employment shortage is that much greater as we struggle to reclaim America. Perhaps we should allow this through?"
 pacificstates.62.a:0 "Yes, we need the labour."

 pacificstates.63.t:0 "Hollywood Bookkeeping"
 pacificstates.63.d:0 "The decision to promote true American values with a closer relationship with Hollywood seemed smart initially. However, the glitz and glamour of Hollywood shady accounting practices that confound our ability to measure returns. Patriotic productions privately financed receive royalties out of gross sales, which have been very high. However, the deal we accepted was on profits, which appear to be next to nothing. This inconsistency needs to be renegotiated, and the studios be told that such creative accounting cannot fly with the American government!"

 pacificstates.64.t:0 "Pacific Movement of the Eastern World Uncovered"
 pacificstates.64.d:0 "We initially thought that our intelligence service was overreactive when they warned us of Japanese infiltration, but this revelation justifies the time spent. Our of our new West Coast operations, agents uncovered pamphlets sent to prominent Japanese and African American leaders questioning the validity of our government. These pamphlets were traced to an organisation called the Pacific Movement of the Eastern World, whose leadership appears to advocate in favour of a Pacific Japanese Alliance that advocates for unrestricted imperial growth of Japan in Asia. This organisation appears to target non-Chinese ethnic minorities with promises of greater social freedom. We have arrested the conspirators, but we were unable to tie them to the Japanese embassy surprisingly."
 pacificstates.64.a:0 "What a strange group."

 pacificstates.65.t:0 "Communalism and the Latter-Day Saints Church"
 pacificstates.65.d:0 "The Church of Jesus Christ and Latter-Day Saints, better known as Mormons, have expressed sentiments in recent months to strengthen the ideals of Communalism within the church in order to counter the sway of syndicalism. Notably the Church has come out with a faith-based welfare program, called coincidentally enough the Church Welfare Program, to help provide for support for fellow Mormons, furthermore the program calls for more Bishop Storehouses to be created. Due to the churches influence in the western states, this has also translated into increased support for the Progressive and Farmer-Labor Parties."

 pacificstates.73.d:0 "'This morning I came, I saw and I was conquered, as everyone would be who sees for the first time this great feat of mankind. Ten years ago the place where we are gathered was a sparse, forbidding desert. In the bottom of a gloomy canyon, whose precipitous walls rose to a height of more than a thousand feet, flowed a turbulent, dangerous river. The mountains on either side of the canyon were difficult of access with neither road nor trail, and their rocks were protected by neither trees nor grass from the blazing heat of the sun. The site of Boulder City was a cactus-covered waste. The transformation wrought here in these years is a twentieth-century marvel.' Thus begins [PSA.GetLeader]'s Speech dedicating the creation of Boulder Dam that has finally been completed today."

Now that they have power, the question is how exactly shall railway nationalisation go. Congress is debating between two different proposals for how this shall be implemented. The first proposal is that the railroads will be nationalised but not the cars allowing for private businesses to compete among themselves for customers, while the second plan would include the cars in the nationalisation. Which version shall Congress go with?"

 pacificstates.101.t:0 "Perez v. Sharp"
 pacificstates.101.d:0 "The case involving the marriage of Andrea Perez to Sylvester Davis has finally reached the Supreme Court. Andrea Perez is classified as White while Sylvester Davis is considered Negro as per the US Census. However, California's law forbids "All marriages of white persons with Negroes, Mongolians, members of the Malay race, or mulattoes are illegal and void" and that "no license may be issued authorising the marriage of a white person with a Negro, mulatto, Mongolian or member of the Malay race". Consequently county clerk W. G. Sharp followed California Law and refused to give them their marriage licenses.\n\nHowever, Perez with the help of their lawyer, Daniel G. Marshall, brought forth a Writ of Mandamus. Within the trial, one of the arguments that was brought up was the fact that both Perez and Davis were Catholic and wanted a Catholic Marriage that included mass. By denying them the license, they stated that the state was depriving them of the Holy Sacrament of Matrimony.\n\nHowever, the fate of their case is within the hands of the Supreme Court. What shall be decided?"

 pacificstates.102.d:0 "In Los Angles news has been made of José Gallardo Díaz, who was recently found murdered near a swimming hole in Commerce, near LA. However, what made the story more newsworthy was the case of the men who are accused of murdering the man. The LA Police found a gang of 17 Men, of Mexican-American descent, nearby and believe that they are responsible for the crime. This has attracted something of a media circus as activists have tried to protest the actions claiming that these men are not the killer and are innocent, the fact that there is insufficient evidence to link them. Despite this nine of them were convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to serve time in San Quentin Prison, with the rest being imprisoned in Los Angeles County jail.\n\nThe case has generated much animosity within the white populace towards Mexican-Americans, not helped by the fact that both the Police and the Press have characterised all Mexican Youths as 'pachuco hoodlums and baby gangsters.'"

 pacificstates.103.d:0 "With the war going on, rations have been imposed upon the public. Despite this, some within the Mexican-American Community fount this by wearing Zoot Suits that use materials that are needed for the war effort. Many White Americans regard wearing the Zoot Suit as a sign of criminality and loose morals. Tensions have continued in Los Angeles to rise till they exploded into violence. Soldiers and Sailors beat and engaged in rioting against the Mexicans. Meanwhile, the local press tended to praise the Sailors and Soldiers of 'having a cleansing effect to rid Los Angeles of Miscreants and Hoodlums'. One journalist on the scene, Carey McWilliams, wrote:\n\n'Marching through the streets of downtown Los Angeles, a mob of several thousand soldiers, sailors, and civilians, proceeded to beat up every zoot suiter they could find. Pushing its way into the important motion picture theatres, the mob ordered the management to turn on the house lights and then ran up and down the aisles dragging Mexicans out of their seats. Streetcars were halted while Mexicans, and some Filipinos and Negroes, were jerked from their seats, pushed into the streets and beaten with a sadistic frenzy'"

Their shops have been looted and more atrocities have been lumped upon them. The Gringo Press has even joined in on the action urging them to continue with their actions. To many within the Mexican Congress, this is an outrage. Our own citizens who have gone to America for temporary work, not to mention those with ties to Mexico due to ancestral are being mistreated.

To calm tensions between America and Mexico, the McGucken Committee has been created lead by the Archbishop of Los Angeles, Joseph Thomas McGucken. The report concluded that Racism was clearly at the centre of the riots as well as stating 'an aggravating practice (of the media) to link the phrase zoot suit with the report of a crime.' The governor of California appointed the Peace Officers Committee on Civil Disturbances, chaired by Robert W. Kenny, president of the National Lawyers Guild to make recommendations to the police.

In the movie Kane's career in the publishing world is born of idealistic social service, but gradually evolves into a ruthless pursuit of power.

This years' Congressional Budget has fortunately found some money to allocate to a long-term project. Three plans are presented to the military high command to meet and exceed the military projects of our rivals. The first is a rocket by Goddard theoretically capable of delivering explosives from miles away without risking pilot lives. The second is Oppenheimer's planned theoretical bomb using radioactive heavy metals as researched in Austria and Germany.

 pacificstates.150.d:0 "Ever since the first peaceful transfer of power between George Washington and John Adams, the government of the United States has prided itself on respecting the wishes of its population after an election. This unspoken contract between the people and their government has been violated by General Douglas MacArthur. In deposing the democratically-elected president in the name of 'preserving stability', he shattered the founding principles of our great nation. The destruction of the healthy civil-military relationship that has marked America since independence is a grievous slight to all the values we hold as a nation.\n\nIn response, the governors of California, Washington, and Oregon have issued a joint declaration condemning the General’s actions, and demanding his immediate withdrawal from Washington. We doubt he will respond positively, but like the patriots in 1776, we must take a stand against tyranny and oppression."

Claiming that MacArthur’s overthrow of the government was illegitimate, a new election would be held to select a new president - albeit amongst a limited slate of candidates in the Pacific region. Still, according to Merriam, whoever won this election would still have more legitimacy than MacArthur, and would be tasked with overseeing the return of the nation to democracy - by force, if needs be."

Those naive aspirations were dashed when Governor Merriam ordered the National Guard to violently suppress a syndicalist protest which broke out in Sacramento. This escalated into widespread rioting across many Western cities, with Seattle in particular descending into violence. Longshoremen and teamsters broke into Seattle city hall, and proclaimed the city loyal to Reed’s workers republic in Chicago.

While some of the ships in Naval Base San Diego were transferred to the East Coast after the first signs of unrest, many remained - along with sailors from across the country. Details are sketchy, but it appears a base commander, on orders from Washington, ordered sailors to take weapons from the base armoury and head into the city. Deploying themselves at polling places, they prevented poll workers from setting up. When morning came, large mobs surrounded these soldiers, and began pelting them with rocks, bottles, and other debris.

 pacificstates.154.d:0 "As the federal government's deadline looms, it has become clear there will be no budging on either side. Newly-elected President [Root.GetLeader] has been busy raising militia across the West, amidst a growing determination to see the country restored and MacArthur defied. The federal government, in turn, has also made it clear they no longer see a path to compromise with the Pacific states."

 pacificstates.200.t:0 "The Army Requisitions Civilian Trucks"
 pacificstates.200.d:0 "After Marshall announced his Motorisation program for the W.D.C., a proposal was sent to the President to decide on the requisition of civilian vehicles in order to supply our fast-growing army. With his approval, we have begun seizing vehicles from the civilian populace, although to our surprise, some proud patriots line up next to our storages to volunteer their vehicles for the incoming fight. While not all their vehicles have proven to be useful for us, we have managed to requisition a fair amount of trucks which can either be modified to transport troops with ease or which are sturdy enough to transport our troops at once."

 pacificstates.202.t:0 "Failure of Operation Glacier"
 pacificstates.202.d:0 "While Operation Glacier managed to get some territorial gains, the losses were too high with a gain too small to matter for the war effort.

 pacificstates.203.t:0 "Rethinking our Tank Designs"
 pacificstates.203.d:0 "With the Civil war over, we now have to revise the industrial measures we undertook during the war in order to enhance war-time production. One of these measures was Marshall's request for faster tanks for mass production, which came with the unfortunate drawback of being unreliable on harsh terrain, a trait which unfortunately has caused more than one headache to the newly recruited tank crews of our nation. Since our spending in military affairs shall be increased, some designers have approached us with newer models with better engines and suspension systems which shall ensure no regular breakdowns happen, but in exchange our experts predict our production speed will be reduced. What should we do?"

 pacificstates.204.d:0 "Local newspapers have reported a massive increase in activity by the Progressive Party and Farmer-Labor parties. While this shift would be understated in previous years, the existence of dictatorial powers in the Federal Government has unsettled many reliable voters in the Pacific States. This shift has reached the provisional Congress in Sacramento, where several minor Representatives have made public statements endorsing the Progressives and Farmer-Labor. To the observers in the rest of the US, this shift validates their concerns that the establishment Democrats and Republicans have become totally estranged from the two party system."

Just like Abraham Lincoln seventy-five years ago, President [PSA.GetLeader] has saved democracy and the Union. Now that the war is over, the lessons learned from the Crisis of '37 and the war must be studied and applied. While there is indeed much willingness in the government to reform the system, there is no consensus on how to proceed.\n\n Was the independent military administration responsible for the descent into chaos, or too-close civilian-military cooperation? Was the Electoral College and House of Representatives presidential selection the obsolete technicality that caused the war, or were the Founding Fathers right about the biddable common people, who needed to be contained and channelled by the elites? Clearly both Huey Long and Jack Reed tapped into populist strands of thought, but was there deep popular anger with the old democratic government, or have we forgotten our fear of the easily stirred mob? All these questions and others must now be answered, but by the grace of Almighty God America now has a government ready to try."

At Berkeley, Wu’s intellect, beauty, and charisma has earned the respect of her mentors such as Robert Oppenheimer and Ernest O.

###############################################
 PSA_HENRY_ARNOLD_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L June 25, 1886, in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L Henry Harley "Hap" Arnold, a member of the distinguished American Arnold dynasty from which several politicians and military officers were part of, signed up for West Point when he had just turned 17. While he wanted to join the Cavalry corps, his grades and overall performance in the academy caused him to be assigned to the 29th Infantry Regiment, stationed at the Philippines. In April 1911, he requested a transfer to the Signal Corps, where he completed his instruction as an aviator on May. He'd continue his pioneering work in the air force throughout the late 1910s, and became fascinated by the aircraft developments in the Weltkrieg. During the Twenties, he joined up his colleague William Lendrum Mitchell to fight for an independent air force, which lead to Mitchell being court-martialled. Arnold stood, along with other renowned airmen, in defence of Mitchell but failed to win the trial. Arnold would continue to fight for an independent air force, trying to sway congressmen and recruit pilots to his cause, until he was sent to Fort Riley for 'attempting to influence legislation in an improper manner', where he spent the next few years writing books trying to interest young people in the air force. He'd return in 1928 to enter the Army's Command and General Staff School, from where he graduated in 1929. He'd continue changing posts in the American army until 1935, where he was assigned with the General Headquarters Air Force, the closest thing to an independent Air Force he had been in all his career, being promoted to Brigadier General in March 2, 1935. With the outbreak of the Civil War, 'Hap' found himself in the West Coast of America, where due to his constant disagreements with the national Chief of Air Corps of the Federal Government, he decided to join the Pacific Governors in their struggle, and provide any technical expertise he is able to in exchange for the promise of an independent air force."
 PSA_DADDY_MARSHALL_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L December 21, 1880, in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L George Catlett Marshall Jr. began his military career in the Virginia Military Institute in 1900, graduating in 1902 as a second lieutenant of the United States Army. Marshall was posted in the Philippines during the Philippine-American war, as well as helping to contain guerrilla operations in the area post-war. During the Weltkrieg, Marshall was sent to France, along with many other American officers as observers, where he was promoted to Captain for his observations. After working as aide-de-camp of General Pershing for a short time in 1919, he began being assigned to several positions in the army, mainly to relay his experience in the Weltkrieg to more inexperienced officers as well as helping the army modernise its doctrine. During this time, he became a key planner and writer in the War Department, commanded the 15th Regiment in the Legation Cities and taught the at the Army War College until 1927. Having being promoted to lieutenant colonel, he was appointed as assistant commandant of the Infantry School at Fort Benning, where he appointed Edwin F. Harding in charge of the school's publication. He'd be posted on different Infantry regiments until being promoted to colonel in 1933 and was promoted to his current rank of Brigadier General in late 1935 due to fear of desertion of several important members of the officer corps. With MacArthur's takeover of the government, Marshall refused to recognise his colleague as the army's generalissimo, and when the Pacific Governors declared their revolt, Marshall decided to join them, which earned him the promotion to Field Marshall. He is widely considered one of the most brilliant planners in America, and is one of the most experienced members of our staff.\n§YImportant Notes:§L- Born from a Democrat father and a Republican mother, Marshall has become a politically tolerant man, both publicly and privately."
 PSA_ALEXANDER_PATCH_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L November 23, 1889, in Fort Huachuca, Arizona, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L Alexander McCarrell "Sandy" Patch, the son of the Cavalry Captain Alexander M. Patch, started his military career when he joined West Point in 1909. While a fan of the cavalry corp, he was quick to realise that cavalry would soon enough become obsolete in combat, so he chose to join the infantry, and graduated from West Point as a second lieutenant in 1913. His first assignment was the 18th Infantry Regiment based in Texas, from where he was assigned to Pershing's 'Punitive Expedition' to Mexico, where he earned his promotion to first lieutenant. Without any major engagements for the US, Patch reached the rank of Captain in 1919 and was posted at Fort Benning as an instructor for four years. He'd apply for the Staunton Military Academy in Virginia as a professor of military science and tactics, a role which he'll keep until very recently. In the meantime, he attended the Field Officer's Course in 1922 and the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School, where he graduated with distinction in 1925, and finally graduated from the U.S. Army War College in 1932 as a lieutenant colonel. Patch's remarkable service record impressed General George Marshall, who tried to keep close contact with Patch in the following years of his graduation. When the civil war break out, Marshall implored Patch to join his staff in the Pacific Army, a request that Patch accepted and for which he was promoted to Brigadier General."
 PSA_LEWIS_BRERETON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L June 21, 1890, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L Lewis Hyde Brereton began his military career in 1907, when he joined the Naval Academy with his brother and graduated in June 1911. However, before graduating he submitted a letter for resignation citing seasickness, which would make him unable to serve as a naval officer. His resignation was accepted, and he applied to be commissioned in the US Army and was appointed as a second lieutenant in the Coast Artillery Corps on August 17, 1911. In September 1912, he undertook flight training in Rockwell Field, and would work temporarily on the air corp until he survived his second crash, after which he requested to be relieved from duty. He returned to the Coast Artillery Corps and in July 1916, he was promoted to first lieutenant and sent to the Philippines and would serve a year before returning to the US in March 1917, where he was assigned to duty in the Aviation Sector Headquarters in Washington D.C...

With Mitchell's resignation, his life took a downturn, as his wife left him, he suffered a crash and was found AWOL by accident while his mental health deteriorated greatly due to these developments. He was restored into service in August 1927 and was assigned to command of the 88th Observation Squadron at Post Field, Oklahoma, as well as an instructor at the Field Artillery School in Fort Sill. In 1931 he was posted in the Panama Canal Zone and received a promotion to lieutenant colonel in 1935 due to an excelling performance, which allowed him to salvage his reputation of his misfortunes in the late twenties. With the outbreak of the civil war becoming increasingly inevitable, he took a ship and arrived to San Diego right before hostilities began in order to meet his old acquaintance,'Hap' Arnold. Despite his inexperience in practical infantry combat, his excellent administrative and planning skills allowed him to become Brigadier General, by Arnold's own request."

He was later assigned to the 15th Infantry Regiment in the Legation of Tianjin, where he learned to speak almost perfect Mandarin Chinese, and returned to the US to undergo a course in the Command and General Staff School, where his excellent grades made him eligible for an exchange program with the German Kriegsakademie, departing in early 1936. He never finished his courses however, as the Civil War began, and MacArthur took the reins of the government, Wedemeyer decided to travel back home and join the Pacific Forces, who he sees as the true American government.

He took several posts throughout the US and abroad, mostly following the steps of his father until his death in 1934. With his father's death, he was assigned to Seattle, where he had to put down several strikes in the name of the central government as the national situation deteriorated.
