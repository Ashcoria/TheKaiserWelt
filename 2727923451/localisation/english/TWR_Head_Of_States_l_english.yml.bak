Sihanouk became the king of Cambodia at the age of 19, appointed by the Governor-General of French Indochina Jean Decoux. The first years of Sihanouk's reign would be of little strife, having no interest in politics. When the Japanese came and occupied his nation, Sihanouk watched movies instead of providing for his people. In 1945, under pressure of the Japanese government after the Meigo Sakusen, Sihanouk declared the independence of the Kingdom of Cambodia and making him prime minister while serving as king at the same time. Cambodian independence would not last long, as the British, with American support, occupied Indochina. The British Mandate of Cambodia (1946-1950) was formally established, with the eventual goal to liberalize the nation, turning it into a model democracy. After 4 years of heavy reformations, supported by the republican Son Ngoc Thanh and inspired by the British system, Cambodia finally recieved its independence from the British Empire, beginning the Kingdom of Cambodia's first era of sovereignty. During this period, Sihanouk has clearly become annoyed by his small roll as king and has started to challenge the democratic institutions put upon him, hoping to expand his political power.\n§g§!"
vacant_crown_desc:0 "\n§YVacant Throne§!\n\nDescription:\n§gThe crown of the Spanish people has remained empty without owner for almost 21 years now. While Francisco Franco, Caudillo of Spain and the one ruling by decree, had promised a return of the monarchy after the 1947 referendum on the Spanish law of succesion, he has yet to make a decision. As the only one with the power to decide either a regent or king, Franco is stuck between a rock and a hard place, as his supporters are split on the issue: The Carlists mostly agree upon Xavier of Bourbon-Parma as the next in line for the title of Spanish king, while the Alfonsists seek to restore the Bourbon monarchy of Spain, which was overthrown in 1921 with the establishment of the second Spanish Republic. Next to these main rivalries also rest the internal divisions among carlists and alfonsists, making a restoration of the monarchy unlikely to not be controversial.§!"

Paul_von_Lettow_Vorbeck_DESC:0 "Name:\n§YPaul von Lettow-Vorbeck§!\n\nDescription:\n§gPaul von Lettow-Vorbeck, born 20th of March 1870 in Saarlouis. Coming from a small nobility of Pomerania, the Lion of Africa has served under the German Empire with utmost loyalty, being a true supporter of Kaiser Wilhelm II and patriot to his country. Becoming a renowned figurehead of German strength and heroism after the First World War, the heroic tales of his defense of German East Africa are known far and wide by not only Germans but Brits and Americans alike. After being forced to retire from his military service in October 1919 after a failed coup attempt against the Weimar Republic, he became an author for most of the 1920s. From 1928 to 1930 he involved himself in German Politics, becoming a deputy in the Reichstag for the German National People's Party, which was a right leaning Monarchist movement for the restoration of the House of Hohenzollern. After leaving the party in July 1930, because he disagreed with the new party policies of Alfred Hugenberg, he ran for office as the head of the Conservative People's Party which saw little to no success whatsoever, after which he retired from politics.\n\nAlthough he was always very suspicious of Hitler's leadership and his policies, often even going as far as questioning and outright denouncing them, the Reich called upon him after the conclusion of the German Civil War to take the position of Reichspräsident. A hero of the German people, a seasoned military expert and a patriot, with these traits he was swiftly and decisively voted into office by the Wehrmacht to rule over the nation as its new leader. However, as good as this may seem for the military it is actually a reason to worry for many. Lettow-Vorbeck is still not a true supporter of National Socialism and its harsh policies, still upholding his distaste for many of those who follow it. His independent and free thinking path may prove a challenge for the stability of Germany, if it was to clash with the interests of the military, whose interests now represent those of the Greater German Reich...§!"
Eberhard_von_Mackensen_DESC:0 "Name:\n§YEberhard von Mackensen§!\n\nDescription:\n§gEberhard von Mackensen, born  24 September 1889 in Bromberg. Fourth Child to the famous "Last Hussar" August von Mackensen. Standing in the shadow of his father for his entire life, he tried to make a name for himself by starting his own military career as early as 1908, in which he has served the German Empire, the Weimar Republic and now the Third Reich. Serving in both World Wars he fought many battles ever since, ranging from leading the 12th Army in France to the 1st Panzer Division in the Battle of Kiev during Operation Barbarossa. By the end of the war he had reached the rank of Generaloberst and was awarded the Iron Cross of 2nd Class. However, despite all of his achievements one cannot deny the shadow his father's legacy still casts over Eberhard's own life. With the military taking charge in the Greater German Reich following the conclusion of the German Civil War, he has been put into power over the country as the new Reichspräsident. Viewed as nothing more than a dull military man by the public, with no regards for politics whatsoever he seems perfectly fit to lead the new Germany which is dominated by the policies of the Wehrmacht.\n\nThe new Reichspräsident stands at a crossroads. It is up to debate if he will continue to be a personal lapdog of the military for their own interests, or if he will finally will find his own political path independent from those who put him into power. Whether he will lead Germany into greatness and bypass his father's legacy, or if his leadership will crumble before he can achieve such a goal remains to be seen.§!"
Wilhelm_Canaris_DESC:0 "Name:\n§YWilhelm Franz Canaris§!\n\nDescription:\n§gWilhelm Franz Canaris, born 1st of January 1887 in Aplerbeck, Dortmund. From a U-Boat Commandant in the First World War, a German spy in Spain, to a Freikorps member in the interwar years, and finally, the leader of the German Abwehr in early 1935, Canaris has truly proven his loyalty and faith in the Fatherland. Ever since he was made head of the Abwehr he has been the mastermind behind numerous political as well as military moves which further cemented the legacy and influence of the Reich, ranging from pulling strings in the Anschluss of Austria to the greenlighting of German weapons and troops being deployed in Spain to support dictator Francisco Franco. However, despite his service to Germany and his numerous achievements one can only be baffled how such a high ranking official could be accused of secretly plotting against the Führer. Canaris was accused of having orchastered large parts of the 1948 coup, which was later dismissed by the Gestapo as nothing more as vague rumors that have been put into the world by certain members of the SS, whom he never had good relations with. He was known for publicly denouncing the war crimes of the Schutzstaffel on the Eastern Front from 1941 to 1943 for their sheer brutality and disregard for human life.\n\nNow that the storm over Germany has started to slowly fade and with the nation making first attempts of recovery after the bloody civil war, Canaris has been called upon by the Wehrmacht to take the spot of the new Reichspräsident.\n\nWith his incredibly achievements in the prewar era and his impression of a true loyalist, he surely will prove to be a fit choice for the new Germany whose policy is dominated by the Wehrmacht, which he is so fond of, due to his own service in recent years. However, one can only wonder if there wasn't more to the accusations of the SS and that fateful day in 1948...§!"

Peter_II_DESC:0 "Name:\n§YPetar II Karađorđević§!\n\nDescription:\n§gPeter II Karađorđević, born on September 6, 1923, was the last king of Yugoslavia, both from Karađorđević's house and in general. He was the son of King Alexander I Karađorđević and Queen Maria of Romania, while his godparents at his baptism were Queen Elizabeth of Greece, King Ferdinand of Romania and King George VI of the United Kingdom. He was originally educated at the Royal Palace, from where he continued his education in England until the moment when his father was shot in Marseilles by the VMRO when he was 11 years old. The regency on his behalf was led by his uncle Pavle. Petar did not intend to give up his father's policy of leading Yugoslavia and wanted to continue with the further centralization of power in Yugoslavia as well as the breakup of every separatist movement, but he was hindered in that idea by the incredible genius of his uncle and Dušan Simović later. As time passed on the occasion of unpopular moves made by Pavle with Cvetković and Maček, Petar became more and more popular, and when Pavle decided to sign the Tripartite Pact, the genius of Dušan Simović became apparent. In a bloodless coup, Peter II became the last king of Yugoslavia at the age of 17 and a half and established a very pro-British government, mixing ministers from all parties, except the far-right Serbian groups and Ustaše and the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. His reign did not last long and on April 6 he was forced by Dušan Simović to flee to Montenegro where a plane to Greece awaited them where a plane to Jerusalem awaited them where a plane to Cairo awaited them where a plane to London awaited them while along the way he promised at press conferences that the fight would never end. After the collapse of the British and French armies after Dunkirk, Peter II remained in London, from where he coordinated his actions with Draža Mihailović, but it seemed that Serbia would never be freed from slavery again, so he indulged in alcohol and depression. It slowly began to disappear as soon as it was noticed that a problem with Hitler's health broke out in Germany, and it was thought that the moment of liberation would finally come. After the successful operation of the liberal government and the Chetniks, the king was successfully returned to Serbia, where he was crowned with his old crown.§!"

Quickly joining the Independent State of Croatia when it was founded in 1941, he was tasked with founding the elite Black Legion alongside Rafael Boban and Jure Francetić, an elite militia decorated for its fierce fighting against Red Partisans and Serbian Chetniks. Returning to Zagreb in 1944 to assume the position of Chief of the Army, he slowly became disillusioned with Ustaše ideology as their multiple failures began to pile onto each other. The economic collapse, the Bosnian rebellion and the lack of any real social progress would prove to be the last straw for Vokić as he began conspiring with Lorković and the moderate conservative HSS to topple the bloated regime and rebuild Croatia in their own image.
