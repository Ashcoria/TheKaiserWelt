 CSA_red_guard_commander_desc:0 "This leader, while still inexperienced by normal military standards, has shown skill in commanding the Red Guard militias before the American Civil War. This knowledge should prove valuable."

### Leaders ###
 POLITICS_CSA_CENTRAL_COMITTEE_DESC:0 "The victory of the working class is the collective victory of all true Americans. The American people of old still coalesce around the Central Committee as did the founders around the Constitutional Convention, though our goals be more noble. Here the liberators of socialism debate the future of our nation, and factions that John Reed united now form under their own visions of the future."
 POLITICS_ELIZABETH_FLYNN_DESC:0 "At a dusty underground socialist club in Harlem, Elizabeth Flynn's life as an advocate began. An early organiser for the IWW in New Jersey, Flynn felt the blunt of the political wrath against forming trade unions, and was arrested ten times. Flynn helped found the ACLU, which organised legal defence for strikers in the days before the International Labor Defence. In the leadup to the civil war, Flynn helped organise the Longshoremen strike of the West Coast. Flynn's wartime speeches to the Central Committee to encourage conscription made her stand out to the numerous conscientious objectors in the Committee. Ultimately Flynn was elected to lead America as a shocking dark horse candidate. Some thought it absurd that a woman would stand at the forefront of the revolution, but the rebel girl herself had been at the spearhead all along, fighting since the founding of the IWW and now ready to build up a socialist America of her dreams."
 POLITICS_NORMAN_THOMAS_DESC:0 "Norman Thomas has seen the lows and the highs of social stature, and remained dedicated to socialism the entire way through from newspaper boy to Princeton magna cum laude to conscientious objector. Prior to the civil war he had served as New York City's mayor and Jack Reed's vice-presidential candidate. Thomas pivoted his pacifism during the war into advocacy for socialists living in the Federal lands to resist conscription. After the war, he used his learned experience and close friendship to Jack Reed, preaching on behalf of the Federalists to lead the democratic socialists to victory in the Second Constitutional Convention. With a heart of gold and unshakable morals, Norman Thomas has ascended to the presidency."
 POLITICS_EARL_BROWDER_DESC:0 "Born in Kansas, in the year of 1891, Browder became a committed socialist at age 16. His allegiance to the Socialist Party of America was unshakable, and through an early friendship with William Z. Foster, he became a syndicalist. As the years passed, the two men began to drift apart. While Foster favoured an authoritarian form of syndicalism, Browder began to see more and more limits with the movement. The American revolution has according to him, proven that the same beliefs and strategies used in Europe cannot be applied to America. His new economic policy has been built with inspiration from Bolshevism, reinterpretations of Maximism, and plenty of original thought. Browder also intends to end the persistent trend of industrial unionism in Congress, and to pursue lecherous religious elements within the socialist state. Browder has never abandoned the Socialist Party of America, but with his new authoritarian position he intends to ensure that the party will never abandon him."
 POLITICS_WILLIAM_FOSTER_DESC:0 "A radical labour organiser who spearheaded the syndicalist movement in America, William Z. Foster has practically become a legend on the American left. His leadership in the strikes of the early 20th century and his commitment to seeing the Socialist Party of America adopt Syndicalist policies has cemented him as one of its chief ideologues. His famous manifesto, "Toward Syndicalist America" has served as the guidebook for every aspiring Totalist in the country, containing Foster's culminated ideals for how to build America into what it is today. With the recent victories of the Vanguard movement of the Combined Syndicates, Foster was uplifted to lead the new nation. Several of Foster's older, more socially ambitious ideas now come to the fore. This includes plans to reform the socialist human being as a whole, and to re-orient American morals towards the vanguard of socialism."
 POLITICS_JAMES_CANNON_DESC:0 "Personally mentored by Big Bill Haywood and well-versed in the struggles of the American left, James Cannon became an unshakable presence within the Socialist Party of America. Although initially a fanatic adherent to Bolshevism, the failure of the Russian Revolution contrasted with the triumph of the French syndicalists caused Cannon to adopt a more libertarian view on socialism. As a formal representative of the SPA, he spent much time abroad in France and Britain, before returning to America after the outbreak of the civil war. Helping to organise foreign volunteers and the Internationale's advisers, he cemented his reliability as a brilliant administrator. With the war won, Cannon immediately began to build the momentum needed to run for President, and has now finally fulfilled his ambition!"
 POLITICS_CARLO_TRESCA_DESC:0 "Born to an impoverished family in Italy, Tresca's emigration to America became the first major step in a tumultuous life which saw him soon emerge as Secretary of the Italian Socialist Federation of North America. Having built up a famed reputation as an anarchist, a strike organiser and a community leader among Italian immigrants, Tresca became an integral figure within the IWW. His oratory and legal skills were put to use defending men such as Sacco and Vanzetti, as well as stopping the infiltration and manipulation of trade unions by the Italian Mafia. He spent much time vocally supporting the revolution in his homeland Italy, defending the merits, accomplishments and potentials of the Italian Socialist Republic to his fellow Italian-Americans. With the outbreak of the American Civil War, Carlo Tresca played a key role in the takeover and new administration of New York City, all while surviving multiple assassination attempts and scores of protests against his campaign for being an Italian immigrant. His prior accomplishments within the Italian Socialist Federation and the IWW have now allowed Carlo Tresca to launch a successful campaign to become President."
 POLITICS_ARTURO_GIOVANNITTI_DESC:0 "Born in Abruzzi, Italy, Arturo was one of the hundreds of thousands who came to the United States seeking opportunity. Arturo instead found a ripe political climate for expanding workers’ rights. Arturo was there during the 1912 Textile Strike of Lawrence, Massachusetts, where his illegal arrest and subsequent trial in a metal cage became a rallying point for the New England IWW. Arturo was acquitted of all charges, and became a socialist activist, first opposing the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, then the US's entry into the war. During the revolution, Arturo led an Italian-American brigade out of New England and into CSA territory under hostile fire. A talent for speaking and poetry elevated his campaign. Ultimately he was elected President as a true citizen."
 POLITICS_MEYER_LONDON_DESC:0 "Born in Tsarist Lithuania under the grip of Russian influence, Meyer's first ambition was to become a Talmudic scholar like his father. The adverse conditions of Russia forced Meyer's family to relocate to New York City, where Meyer became a printer. Printing for Yiddish publications, Meyer had fallen into one such group of radical intellectuals that encouraged him to become a lawyer. Starting in the 1890s, Mayer joined Eugene V. Deb's Social Democratic Party, and was a leading organiser of the 1910 New York Clockmakers Strike. A coalition ticket with Progressives allowed Meyer to become the first of many socialists in Congress. Meyer opposed the United States' entry into the Weltkrieg, and yet aided the McAdoo administration in promoting militancy. Meyer even angered Jewish labour by promoting partisan Jewish organisations above Zionist labour groups. Meyer went undercover during the Crisis of '36, and re-emerged following the war championing many of the issues he was originally against. Meyer the pro-Zionist war hawk was much more popular, even against protesters claiming he couldn't run for President as an immigrant."
 POLITICS_UPTON_SINCLAIR_DESC:0 "Born in 1878, in Baltimore, Upton Sinclair was an aspiring author from an early age. In his teens he wrote pulp magazines and poetry to make a living, eventually moving into investigative journalism. His moment in the spotlight came after he spent seven weeks disguised as a worker in Chicago's meatpacking plants, drafting a political expose on the poor labour conditions of the plants. Although Sinclair had hoped to rally the country behind the worker's cause, he instead merely exposed the lack of hygiene in the meatpacking industry; in response to this reaction, he declared "I aimed for the country's heart, but hit them in the stomach". With the profits from his literary career, Sinclair pursued politics in California, launching the "End Poverty In California" campaign. E.P.I.C, as it came to be known, was not the roaring triumph he had expected, but gave Sinclair enough fame and recognition that he could later pursue a second political career in the new America. Now championing a E.P.I.C movement applied nationwide, Upton Sinclair has won the recent presidential election with a startling margin."
 POLITICS_FRANK_LITTLE_DESC:0 "Born to a family of Oklahoma homesteaders, Frank Little moved to California in order to escape the miserable droughts that had ruined his family's land. Him and his brother both became ministers, but in 1905 Frank became a full-time organiser for the IWW. A proud Wobbly, he soon struck up a friendship with Elizabeth Gurley Flynn and fought alongside her for the rights of unionised workers across the whole country. Frank narrowly survived two separate attempts at lynching by strike breakers, once in Wisconsin and a second time in Montana. Two instances of nearly being murdered caused Little to lay low for several years, only beginning to show his face again around the mine wars of the early 1920s. His political activism was less provocative, and he avoided any more near-death experiences until the outbreak of the civil war. Although too old to fight personally, Frank helped organise a series of militias across the Steel Belt, and was later nominated to serve in the new government. From this position, he could launch a campaign for the presidency, which the elderly union man narrowly won."
 POLITICS_HARRY_BRIDGES_DESC:0 "Harry Bridges was born in Melbourne, Australia in 1901. When he turned 15, he was first introduced to radical labour politics through the Australian branch of the IWW. Emboldened by his contacts with fellow socialists, along with seeing the general deplorable conditions of the poor around the world, he participated in his first general strike in Australia in 1917. Three years later, in 1920, he would move permanently to the US due to the more plentiful work there. He settled in San Francisco, where he joined other local activists in reviving the then-defunct International Longeshoremens Association. In 1934 a period of month-long negotiations between the twenty local branches of the ILA and the dock owners of San Francisco broke down when two longshore workers were murdered. Bridges, the leading negotiator for the ILA during the standoff, convinced over 100 San Francisco unions to join together in a general strike. The ILA fought the city to a standstill, and Bridges was given credit for stopping further police violence. His later Presidential campaign often faced off against protesters who defied the new Amendment giving natural born citizenship to immigrants, and prevailed against them. Using this reputation, he launched a risky but successful campaigned that has lead him to the presidency."
 POLITICS_FRANK_JOHNS_DESC:0 "Initially a carpenter from Oregon, Frank Johns became the leading figure of the regional Socialist Labor Party. Running twice for congress and twice for the presidency, Johns seemed doomed to a lifetime of obscurity as a fringe party candidate. That was until he went through a near death experience in 1928, nearly drowning in an attempt to save a young boy whom had fallen in a frigid river. Forced to retire from the Socialist Labor Party in order to recover from the incident, Johns was given enough time to think and plot out a new career. He began to correspond with several members of the Socialist Party of America, and after being released from the hospital he went on to join them as a fiery orator. Emboldened by his heroism and having narrowly avoided death, Johns later threw himself into the Second American Civil War as a capable and courageous militia leader. Thanks to his military accomplishments and personal reputation, he has now finally been elected President of a brand new America!"
 POLITICS_SEYMOUR_STEDMAN_DESC:0 "It was incomprehensible to many that a simple janitor would go on to become one of the Socialist Party of America's most prominent activists and legal advisers. Initially balancing his job as a janitor at the Northwestern University School of Law with taking evening classes, Stedman managed to pass the bar to became a lawyer in 1891. Although he was at first a democrat, the young Stedman became inducted into socialism when he helped defend Eugene V. Debs during American Railway Union's great strike. His lifelong friendship to Debs saw him chosen as the SPA's vice presidential candidate in 1920, and after Debs' death he became a close advisor to Jack Reed. Having now outlived yet another close comrade, the old and sombre Stedman has run a successful race to become the new President, intent on honouring his old friend's utopian dreams."
 POLITICS_WILLIAM_RODRIGUEZ_DESC:0 "The son of a Spanish immigrant to Illinois, William Rodriguez made his living painting houses until he could eventually afford to pursue a legal degree. Inspired by his brother in law, a radical journalist named J. Louis Engdahl, to join the Socialist Party of America and move to Chicago, the young Rodriguez managed to win a race for the Chicago city council as a dark horse candidate to become the first socialist and first Hispanic to sit on the council. He used his newfound position to attack the city's transit companies and to seek legal reforms. Although eventually ousted by a Democratic-Republican unity candidate, Rodriguez did not give up on politics. He continued to practice law and ran a successful campaign in 1933 to become a judge. Building on a lifetime of legal and political experience, his next triumph came when he ran his most recent successful presidential campaign."
 POLITICS_MORRIS_HILQUIT_DESC:0 "One of the oldest political figures in the Combined Syndicates, Hillquit was born in 1869, to a Jewish family living in Latvia. After his father lost his business, the young Morris and his father crossed the Atlantic in search of a better life. Soon settled in the slums of New York, Hillquit would go on to found the Socialist Party of America alongside Victor Berger and Eugene V. Debs. He ran for the Senate in 1908 from New York City, garnering 21% of the votes. Despite this failure, he would later unsuccessfully run for mayor of NYC and afterwards help organise fellow socialist Meyer London's successful bid for Congress. Despite suffering from numerous bouts of tuberculosis and frequent conflicts with the growing syndicalist wing of the SPA, Hillquit endured long enough to witness the revolution finally sweep through America. Although old and sickly, his seniority and eventful life has netted him a surprising victory in the latest presidential election. His age helped to invalidate dissenters who wanted a natural born citizen as President. Although some remain uncertain if he can finish his current term, President Hillquit has sworn he will serve the interests of all of America's proletariat, no matter his age or health."
 POLITICS_EUGENE_DENNIS_DESC:0 "Born under the name Francis Xavier Waldron, and spending his early life as a labourer and IWW member in California, the young Waldron was driven into exile after the Californian Criminal Syndicalist Act nearly saw him imprisoned for revolutionary political activism. Fleeing to the Commune of France and taking up work as a minor union politician, he became an important link between the Socialist Party of America and the Third Internationale. In 1935 he returned across the Atlantic under the pseudonym "Eugene Dennis" to help organise Jack Reed's campaign in the coming presidential election. His services to Reed were soon rewarded with a series of influential positions within the Combined Syndicates, which served as the stepping stones for his own eventual presidential campaign."
 POLITICS_ELMER_ALLISON_DESC:0 "A self-taught radical from Missouri, Elmer Allison was a founding member of both the Socialist Party of America and the IWW. He was a leading figure in the SPA's radical Washington affiliate, spending much of his life either working in the local cedar mills or atop a soapbox in the streets of Seattle. A series of raids and near arrests by the Department of Justice saw him go underground, but he remerged as a political figure when he helped lead the brief rebellion known as the Seattle Commune in 1923. During the Commune's existence he met Jack Reed, striking up a friendship with the famed journalist and following him to New York City. There he was a major figure in running Reed's numerous political campaigns and leading the SPA's entry into mainstream politics. Following the revolution, his close comradeship to Reed and his zealous socialist beliefs has made him an obvious candidate for the presidency. A candidacy he gladly pursued!"
 POLITICS_ELIZABETH_NORD_DESC:0 "Elizabeth Nord grew up as the daughter of a family of poor English coal miners, having to spend her early teenage years toiling in a silk factory. Her family departed Britain a few years shy of the British Revolution, settling across the Atlantic in Rhode Island. In the United States, Nord spent another decade as a factory worker during which she used her political finesse and determination to rise through the ranks of her local union, being elected Chairwoman. She became one of the key leaders of the Great Textile Strike of 1934, organising the walkout of tens of thousands of workers across the country. On the outbreak of the Second American Civil War, she was a political representative of her union in Washington, D.C., but quickly made her way across the frontlines to the Combined Syndicates of America. Repeating the same gruelling political manoeuvring that put her in charge of the Great Textile Strike, Elizabeth Nord has now risen to lead something far greater than a union or a strike; she has become the new President!"
 POLITICS_DAVID_DUBINSKY_DESC:0 "David Dubinsky, a Polish Jew who spent his early life organising bunds, leading strikes, and campaigning for the Bolsheviks, came to America from the former Russian Empire, where his actions had netted him a prison sentence in Siberia before he miraculously escaped back to western Russia and caught a ride on a ship to carry him across the Atlantic. Spending much time working in the factories of New York City, Dubinsky became increasingly alienated from the union bureaucracy around him, starting a long-time personal feud between him and the IWW. He initially saw unions as inherently apolitical platforms that should seek further cooperation with the right wing to uplift all workers despite political beliefs, and that compromises with the federal government and business sector were practically mandatory for a union's success. Dubinsky would change his opinion after witnessing first the Great Depression, then the steady rise of Huey Long and finally the outbreak of the Second American Civil War. Although he never made amends with the "union bureaucrats", Dubinsky abandoned compromise with the right wing and capitalism, taking on more politically extreme views. When the civil war finally ended he was singing the praises of the new America, and had already planted the seeds for a political career. Despite his controversial past, it appears David Dubinsky has now been able to reap what he has sown, rising to the position of President in spite of protests from old nativists who resist the proclamation giving him natural-born rights."
 POLITICS_JOHN_LEWIS_DESC:0 "The son of Welsh immigrants whom had settled in Iowa, John Lewis grew up in a company town dominated by the coal industry. At the age of 17 he went to work as a minister, becoming more and more embroiled in his hometown’s local politics and the nationwide labour movement. In 1907 he made a failed attempt to run for mayor, and later became a full-time union advocate who travelled across the Steel Belt. Although he initially bickered with William Z. Foster over the merits of syndicalist trade unions compared to his preferred moderate and apolitical unions, the devastation of the Great Depression saw him slowly embrace more radical beliefs. Despite having once been a liberal and a republican, Lewis could not find it in his heart to endorse President Hoover's second term. Increasingly disillusioned with competitive capitalism, Lewis struck up negotiations with the Socialist Party of America and the IWW. When the American Revolution came, he had made up his mind for which side to stand on. Although his reactionary past continued to haunt him, Lewis eventually succeeded in finding a synthesis between radical unionism and his own moderate ideology, being elected as President in the latest election."
 POLITICS_LUDWIG_KATTERFELD_DESC:0 "Born in Strasbourg under the German Empire and sent away to live with family in America at just 10 years of age, where he later ran away from home, Ludwig Katterfeld had a harsh and formative upbringing. After escaping his extended family, he took up work as a farmhand in Kansas, spending his teenage years balancing hard labour with honing his impressive oratory skills and sharp intellect. The next two decades were a turbulent time for Katterfeld, seeing him become a professed socialist and move from state to state to launch new political ambitions. After graduating college in 1910, he moved to Chicago and led his own short-lived socialist party, the "Lyceum Bureau". He became involved with the Socialist Party of Washington and in 1916 launched a failed gubernatorial bid with them. In 1922 he was the provisional secretary of the Socialist Party of America, and later a representative on their behalf to the Third Internationale. It was in Paris that he met Jack Reed, whom he accompanied back to America the very next year. In 1923 both men played a key role in the brief, radical Seattle Commune. The events of the commune compelled the bitter and austere Katterfeld to go underground, breaking with Reed's desire to go into mainstream electoral politics. From there on Katterfeld worked as an independent activist, not resurfacing until the Civil War. He did not have a chance to reconnect with Reed until the closing days of the revolution, with the latter on his deathbed. Compelled to honour his old friendship to Reed and armed with a lifetime of revolutionary experience, Katterfeld has launched into the spotlight with a narrow victory in the recent presidential race."
 POLITICS_HENNING_BLOMEN_DESC:0 "A son of Massachusetts born in 1910, Henning was too young to experience the horrors of the Weltkrieg, but old enough to face the American Revolution in his prime. Initially an industrial worker in Cambridge, he was one of the few who did not leave his station the moment the first gunshots of the Second American Civil War could be heard. A committed pacifist, Henning Blomen instead helped organise the chemical plant he worked at into a cooperative syndicate. His efforts were greatly appreciated by his more radical co-workers, who nominated him as a Massachusetts representative to the Combined Syndicates and helped him cross the front lines to New York City. Soon climbing his way up the political ladder, Henning Blomen has continuously made a name for himself with his unshakable optimism and iron will, running over a dozen major political races in his lifetime, the most recent of which has carried him all the way to the presidency."
 POLITICS_JOHN_BERNARD_DESC:0 "Initially a French immigrant, Bernard worked nearly a decade of his life in the iron mines of Minnesota, later enlisting in the army. He served along the Mexican border during the Mexican Revolution. He returned to Minnesota a year later, where he found himself blacklisted from employment because of his trade union activism. Changing course to pursue a career in firefighting and then as a politician, Bernard managed to be elected to the House of Representatives on the ticket of the Farmer-Labor Party in 1936. While in office, he became more and more aligned with Jack Reed's popular front of socialists, and began to campaign for friendlier relations between America and the Commune of France. Distinguishing himself as a diligent proletarian and cunning politician, John Bernard has gone a step further and made a successful run for the Presidency."
 POLITICS_OAKLEY_JOHNSON_DESC:0 "A voracious reader since an early age, Oakley Johnson took up a career within academia, serving as a teacher and later principal at numerous schools in his home state of Minnesota. This lasted until his commitment to radical politics became more publicly known, and he was arrested in the middle of a seminar over having contributed money to the defence fund of arrested IWW members. Undeterred, Johnson moved to New York and became a full time activist in the Socialist Party of America, helping to promote interracial relations and the education of the proletariat. In 1936 he accepted a docent position at a university in Paris, spending most of the coming civil war abroad. In Paris he helped maintain diplomatic relations between the Commune of France and his comrades back home in America. Eventually making the trip to the new America, Oakley Johnson has used his diplomatic accomplishments and academic merits to woo the electorate!"
 POLITICS_BAYARD_RUSTIN_DESC:0 "Born in Pennsylvania in the year of 1912, Rustin was raised in a family deeply affiliated with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He was personally acquainted with notables such as W.E.B. DuBois and James Weldon Johnson, developing left-leaning beliefs at an early age. This best showed in 1936 when he organised a student strike at Wilberforce University, over which he was expelled. Cast adrift, the young Rustin moved to New York City where he joined the Young People's Socialist League and got to meet Norman Thomas and A. Phillip Randolph. With the outbreak of the civil war, Bayard Rustin became a political organiser and campaigner for the Combined Syndicates, championing better race relations, increased desegregation, and the immediate overturning of Jim Crow in the newly liberated southern states. Now, decades after the revolution, he has made his daring bid for the presidency despite the fact that Rustin's youth, skin colour, and known homosexual relationships have long been targets of slander and ridicule. Although one might expect any one of those three to have stopped him, he has persevered regardless and been elected the first African-American head of state in American history."
 POLITICS_DARLINGTON_HOOPES_DESC:0 "Darlington Hoopes came from a notable family of Pennsylvania Quakers. During his time at boarding school, he augmented his religious upbringing with an interest in radical socialism, going on to identify as a Christian socialist. His ideological beliefs soon drew him close to fellow Christian socialist Norman Thomas and the rest of the Socialist Party of America. In 1930, Hoopes was elected to the House of Representatives in Pennsylvania, where his most celebrated accomplishment was completely outlawing child labour in his home state. Much like it did to Thomas, the outbreak of the civil war disgusted Hoopes. Although he could not deny its accomplishments in hindsight, his political cause after the war was to champion reconstruction and reconciliation between Americans. This benevolent, reformative platform earned him more and more influence in the new America, allowing him to make a bid for the presidency."
 POLITICS_SMEDLY_BUTLER_DESC:0 "Marine, General and Senator Smedley Butler has done the unthinkable, in the revolution's darkest moment he has overthrown the would-be usurpers and traitors in the Centralist clique, and kept the flame of liberty alive. The old general has been an invaluable warrior for the Combined Syndicates, and his latest startling victory has endeared him to the population tenfold. Although Butler has confided to friends and political allies that he is uneasy to now be in the spotlight, he has agreed to take on the job as the temporarily acting President of the new America until the scars torn open by Totalism can be healed."

### Reconstruction Focuses ###
 CSA_rebuilding_the_country:0 "Rebuilding the Country"
 CSA_rebuilding_the_country_desc:0 "The Revolution is over, but without swift action, the wounds torn open by the Second American Civil War will continue to fester and bleed. We must work with haste to build up an egalitarian, equal, and enduring America, from the ruins of the old."
 CSA_social_revolution_desc:0 "The land of the free and the home of the brave was anything but. We have our work cut out for us in ridding America of corruption, racism, and chauvinism. The first step is to tear up the very core of all these things - the capitalist system itself!"
 CSA_redistribute_wealth:0 "Redistribute Wealth"
 CSA_redistribute_wealth_desc:0 "We will no longer tolerate a social order wherein men who do absolutely nothing useful can amass millions of dollars while millions of proletarians who work all the days of their lives secure barely enough to prolong a wretched existence. The end of the banks, corporations and hoarders is finally here."
 CSA_homes_for_the_people:0 "Homes for the People"
 CSA_homes_for_the_people_desc:0 "Landlords and real estate tycoons have been a plague upon this nation. Now that they have been cast down or fled the country before our righteous advance, we will expropriate their ill-gotten lands and give them to those in need. Let us lift the poor and starving from their slums!"
 CSA_emancipation_for_all:0 "Emancipation for All"
 CSA_emancipation_for_all_desc:0 "Foolish and vain is the working man who makes the colour of his skin the stepping-stone to his imaginary superiority. Proletarians of all colours and creeds fought and bled together to build our new America. The loyal immigrant shall also be afforded natural-born citizenship in the spirit of emancipation."
 CSA_womens_liberation:0 "Women's Liberation"
 CSA_womens_liberation_desc:0 "With the men fighting on the front lines, it fell to the women to run the factories, build the munitions, and feed our revolution! That's to say nothing for the many nurses, pilots and female Red Guard members who gave their all. Their sacrifices and struggles shall not have been in vain; in the new America, women will at last be recognised as truly equal to men."
 CSA_revolutionary_education:0 "Revolutionary Education"
 CSA_revolutionary_education_desc:0 "Academia has been the nurturing mother of many revolutionaries, but the education system itself is still inherently reactionary. Throughout American history, education was designed and reformed to produce more obedient workers, more crooked capitalists, and more heartless politicians. That ends now!"
 CSA_reconstruction:0 "Begin Reconstruction"
 CSA_reconstruction_desc:0 "The Second American Civil War blasted our country to pieces. Large parts of rural America are naught but mud and ashes, while countless cities have been reduced to smouldering rubble. We shall set to work developing new housing and infrastructure as soon as possible."
 CSA_deal_with_feds:0 "Deal with the Feds"
 CSA_deal_with_feds_desc:0 "Since the beginning of the Revolution, we've accumulated an extensive list of political prisoners whom are awaiting trial. Now that the war is over, the time to judge these men has finally come. Although some amongst our leadership believe in rehabilitating these captives, other more radical comrades are eagerly calling for extreme revolutionary justice."
 CSA_transformative_justice:0 "Transformative Justice"
 CSA_transformative_justice_desc:0 "Although we've firmly dealt with the old American elite, there's still a sizeable popular movement opposing our new regime. We'll need to pacify any remaining counter-revolutionary cells, and make sure to track down every last infiltrator in our midst before we can finally be sure we've won."
 CSA_deal_with_firsters:0 "Deal with America First"
 CSA_deal_with_firsters_desc:0 "Huey Long's foul crew of reactionary demagogues, heartless industrialists, and tyrannical generals will finally stand trial. Although the Kingfish himself has escaped capture, we'll eagerly dish out a fair punishment to everyone who collaborated with him."
 CSA_destroy_jim_crow:0 "Destroy Jim Crow"
 CSA_destroy_jim_crow_desc:0 "Ridding ourselves of the southern terrorists will not just be a matter of military might. We'll need to uproot the bigotry and racism that's plagued America for centuries, and crush Long's cult of personality. Let us make Lincoln proud and bring old Dixie down, once and for all!"
 CSA_equality_for_all:0 "Equality for All"
 CSA_equality_for_all_desc:0 "The long-fought battle for true liberty looks to be almost over. The old hierarchies and horrors are fading away. Soon the American injustices will be nothing but bitter memories and the stuff of history books."
 CSA_reconstruction_is_over:0 "The Syndicated Public Service"
 CSA_reconstruction_is_over_desc:0 "Agitation propaganda cannot reach the millions of Americans that object to an overseas war. The Mormons, Mennonites, Jehovah's Witnesses, and Hutterites that refused to fight in the civil war are now offered an outlet in forestry to aid in reconstruction."
 CSA_a_new_america:0 "Revisit and Remember American Heroes"
 CSA_a_new_america_desc:0 "The names of Joe Hill, The Haymarket Martyrs, and even Eugene Debs are famous today, but only as the top layer of a long legacy of American Syndicalist heroes. We must undo years of misinformation about these figures through a concentrated propaganda effort, and also begin to teach a new generation about the legacy of the countless brave American heroes who fought for workers' rights."

### American Commonwealth Focuses ###
 CSA_second_convention:0 "Second Constitutional Convention"
 CSA_second_convention_desc:0 "The time has come to take the next step in our revolutionary struggle and find a way to unite the workers of America behind a single cause and ideology. Although our delegates come from a wide variety of unions and communes, we hope for a consensus on the future of our new socialist government. Just as it was over a century ago, Philadelphia shall be the site of a Constitutional Convention!"
 CSA_american_commonwealth:0 "Commonwealth of America"
 CSA_american_commonwealth_desc:0 "We did not come this far just to fall back into tyranny! Our monumental support in the Constitutional Convention has shown that Union-based Socialism will reign, succeeding the nationalism of Bellamy, but with social and economic freedom for all workers and labourers of our nation!"
 CSA_protect_the_working_class:0 "Protect the Working Class"
 CSA_protect_the_working_class_desc:0 "While many new ideas for a better economic system have existed in theory in America, the turmoil of the civil war made putting any of them into practice a difficult endeavour. Now though, we have ample time and opportunity to build the working man's democracy through amendments protecting worker rights."
 CSA_empower_councils:0 "Townhall Democracy"
 CSA_empower_councils_desc:0 "The new Commonwealth cannot be built through authoritarian means. We must pursue a better class character for our democracy by passing laws empowering grassroots engagement and town hall meetings. Political decisions will no longer be a distant murmur on Capitol Hill; instead, they'll be made right amongst the workers!"
 CSA_mutal_economic_comitee:0 "Craft Union Committee"
 CSA_mutal_economic_comitee_desc:0 "Reforming the capitalist system is be a herculean task, and it can't merely be wished away with state quotas and economic plans. Congress will now begin assembling local representatives of Craft Unions in order to determine the best plan for economic growth while protecting professional workers from obsolescence."
 CSA_councilism:0 "Councilism"
 CSA_councilism_desc:0 "Maintaining America's old bureaucracy is pointless. A compromise between the craft and industrial unions has been reached in the implementation of decentralised worker councils. These Councils will allow states to exert autonomous power in how unions are organised."
 CSA_federalism:0 "Federalism"
 CSA_federalism_desc:0 "Even if the old United States was home to political corruption, gerrymandering and inefficient bureaucracy, its administrative system is an unshakable cornerstone of our national identity. With compromise between craft and industrial unions impossible, we must rely on this cornerstone as the first American revolutionaries did."
 CSA_power_to_the_people:0 "The Ununionized Social Security Act"
 CSA_power_to_the_people_desc:0 "At the urging of the old-age pension activists, Congress has been compelled to reserve some money for a social security fund for ununionised workers. This value is in keeping with our socialist ideals, and breaks ground in ensuring that workers in unprotected industries receive protection as the unionised already do through their retirement funds."
 CSA_federalist_economics:0 "Business Unionism"
 CSA_federalist_economics_desc:0 "Many within the Combined Syndicates mock the idea of 'Business Unionism', calling it a betrayal of the Revolution. What these purists fail to realise is that after two hundred years of capitalism in America, we will need an intermediary economy to ease the transition into socialism. Thus, Congress has ended the system of state-controlled pricing of goods that was implemented under Reed."
 CSA_mutualism:0 "Protectionist Policies"
 CSA_mutualism_desc:0 "The Councils of Professional Workers have concluded that a protectionist policy towards American goods is in order, but not as drastic as the old Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. A softer approach will see increased tax breaks for unions that operate solely in the States, as well as a propaganda push to 'Buy American' just as we should have during the first Weltkrieg."
 CSA_workers_cooperatives:0 "Worker's Cooperatives"
 CSA_workers_cooperatives_desc:0 "The dominance of industrial unions need not mean the death of enterprise! We shall simply replace the bosses who take an unjust cut of the profits. Instead, let the workers decide within their workplaces, dividing the wealth fairly amongst themselves."
 CSA_social_dividends:0 "Social Dividends"
 CSA_social_dividends_desc:0 "Congress has passed a law instituting a basic universal income, wherein a portion of all profit generated from state-run enterprises will be divided amongst our citizens. Our labourers are not just mere subjects, they're the very thing that keep our nation running; therefore, they shall hereby be entitled to some of America's collective wealth!"
 CSA_public_owned_enterprise:0 "Publicly Owned Enterprise"
 CSA_public_owned_enterprise_desc:0 "Public enterprises were for a long time shunned in America, as every one of our old presidents was beholden to the will of Big Business over their electorate. However, now that we've broken the yoke of the corporations, Congress has finally found room to make use of publicly-owned enterprises in the American economy. Rooseveltism and conservationists only hold us back!"
 CSA_american_syndicalism:0 "New American Syndicalism"
 CSA_american_syndicalism_desc:0 "America has finally left exploitative capitalism behind and is now marching eagerly towards a brighter future. Though purists in Congress still mock our idea of 'Syndicalism with American Characteristics', their complaints bear no weight when industries roar with energy, and our people celebrate hitherto-unknown prosperity!"
 CSA_unionist_economics:0 "Industrial Unionism"
 CSA_unionist_economics_desc:0 "Although there has been some push for a synthesis between Syndicalism and Business Unionism, it’s obvious to us that there can be no compromise with the old system. Industrial labour unions must rise to become the dominant force within our economy, just as unions now form the basis of every part of the Commonwealth government."
 CSA_industrial_unionism:0 "Syndicalist Dominance"
 CSA_industrial_unionism_desc:0 "Whereas markets were previously decided by supply and demand, or the whims of investors, our new system will be built by and for demand side economics. Congress has declared that workers must register unions with the IWW or risk fines and loss of benefits."
 CSA_workers_self_managment:0 "Worker's Self-Management"
 CSA_workers_self_managment_desc:0 "A great goal of this Congress is to remove the old hierarchies which permeated American workplaces. Thus, a law illegalises Executive Officers and preferred stockholder voting rights. Now Unions can take control over all of the means of production through common shares ownership."
 CSA_industrial_democracy:0 "Industrial Democracy"
 CSA_industrial_democracy_desc:0 "Democracy is integral to the American identity. Yet for far too long, whatever fig leaf of democracy was left at the factory door as Americans became slaves to petty tyrants. No longer. Congress has mandated a new Industrial Democracy Committee to promote cooperation between unions towards a democratic goal."
 CSA_agricultural_unions:0 "Agricultural Unions"
 CSA_agricultural_unions_desc:0 "The Agricultural sector will be obliged to feed our nation, but other than that broad instruction, we can allow the farmers to operate mostly independently. Congress has extended union protection to agricultural workers, enabling them to unionise and join the IWW."
 CSA_syndicalist_economics:0 "Decentralised Planning"
 CSA_syndicalist_economics_desc:0 "State governments have brought forth an awakening of self-sustaining communes in the cities and even counties. Cooperating closely with their neighbours and maintaining a well-functioning social order. Although this system is nowhere near utopian, it is the first step towards a true worker's paradise!"
 CSA_protect_the_revolution:0 "Protect the Revolution"
 CSA_protect_the_revolution_desc:0 "Maintaining and protecting the spirit of the revolution will be vital in the coming years. We face enormous outside pressure from the reactionary powers around the world, sabotage from dissidents within our own nation, and the strife of factionalism even amongst our leadership. Our will isn't yet broken though, the struggle continues!"
 CSA_general_defense_comitte:0 "General Defence Committee"
 CSA_general_defense_comitte_desc:0 "Entrusting military leadership and the safety our nation to a group of elites can only end poorly. We must ensure that our Commonwealth remains meritocratic and free from corruption, as such Congress has organised a committee of union advisers and military strategists."
 CSA_indepedent_media:0 "Protect Free Speech"
 CSA_indepedent_media_desc:0 "The free media and the right to free speech is an unalienable right to the American people. The Court system has reaffirmed the right to free speech in spite of calls for censorship. Let the reactionaries and traitors shout what they will, their treasonous drivel be drowned out by the cries of our comrades celebrating a new age of prosperity!"
 CSA_strategic_services:0 "Committee of Strategic Services"
 CSA_strategic_services_desc:0 "While the General Defence Committee has proven quite effective it has also been criticised as being too open and public. It is a shame to have to conspire in secret from our citizens, but we can at least ensure that this second Congressional Committee will uphold the spirit of the revolution and be closely supervised."
 CSA_the_revolution_continues:0 "The Revolution Continues"
 CSA_the_revolution_continues_desc:0 "With stability brought to our democratic government, our economy and internal security, we can begin to heal. The scars from the Civil War will last many more years, but that doesn't mean our nation is infirm and weak. The struggle continues, the fires of revolution still burn, and the Commonwealth shall stand tall as a liberating force for all!"

### Union of American States Focuses ###
 CSA_usas:0 "Union of Socialist American States"
 CSA_usas_desc:0 "The authoritarian is ascendant, as the petty squabbles of the Constitutional Convention have ended in favour of a strong and centrist Marxist government. The USAS will show the world that the civil war has done nothing to reduce nations strength and influence, it has merely been redirected to the new revolutionary cause of Vanguardism!"
 CSA_lead_the_revolution:0 "Lead The Revolution"
 CSA_lead_the_revolution_desc:0 "The Vanguardist America is a centrist nation, not subject to IWW mob rule or AFL backsliding. Thankfully, our loyal Craft Unions and anti-Judiciary advocates understand this. Making sure that our new Union does not collapse into infighting, reaction will be the first agenda of our new government."
 CSA_peoples_commisars:0 "People's Commissars"
 CSA_peoples_commisars_desc:0 "Already during the civil war, we had many militias, communes and syndicates adopting a system of Political Commissars. These watchful and vigilant citizens kept a close eye on any potential counterrevolutionaries within our ranks. Congress has allowed these commissars under direct state control, and expanded the system nationwide."
 CSA_control_townhalls:0 "Sign the Hall-Ballam Act"
 CSA_control_townhalls_desc:0 "The issue of loyalty is becoming a wedge that is beginning to drive Congress apart. To fix this, Gus Hall and John Ballam have brought to the floor a Bill to require affidavits of loyalty for USAS elected officials. This law ensures the safety of all by prosecuting those in politics guilty of treason in any form."
 CSA_politics:0 "Democratic Centralism"
 CSA_politics_desc:0 "The concept of Democratic Centralism where once a decision is made by the Central Committee then it must be followed by those lower within the party and government. A Central Committee over Congress was voted in, and they shall have the final say on policy changes. Only reactionaries and traitors should fear us."
 CSA_communist_party:0 "Ban Wall-to-Wall Elections"
 CSA_communist_party_desc:0 "Despite our centralisation of power, there's still some squabbling amongst Congress. We cannot progress if the IWW, AFL, KoL and all the acronyms squabble. Don't they realise the Vanguard is the centrist position, and we are the only things keeping the revolution from tearing itself apart. Thus goes the anarchistic wall to wall elections of the IWW."
 CSA_proletarian_dictatorship:0 "Dictatorship of the Proletariat"
 CSA_proletarian_dictatorship_desc:0 "Everything we have achieved so far has been won with violence and force, the bourgeois thought still clinging to America cannot be voted away, it cannot be debated or discussed away, it must simply be destroyed. How else can anything take its place, if we tolerate the past? Their actions are treason, and the Committee the judge."
 CSA_fosters_economics:0 "Foster's Economic Policy"
 CSA_fosters_economics_desc:0 "William Z Foster has managed to successfully push through his radical policies, as outlined in his manifesto, "Toward Syndicalist America." Foster has immediately called for mass nationalisation of all industries and natural resources, as well as a series of radical reforms to protect unions."
 CSA_resource_nationalization:0 "Resource Nationalisation"
 CSA_resource_nationalization_desc:0 "The establishment of a truly American Syndicalist government will require the confiscation of large landed estates in every Union State. Including the whole body of forests, mineral deposits, lakes, and so on. No longer will Americans be under the yoke of the bourgeoisie."
 CSA_union_managment:0 "Protect Craft Unions"
 CSA_union_managment_desc:0 "The Trade Unions perform a very important function within our economy. But they do not of themselves actually lead the production, this being the responsibility of the government economic organs. Our loyal Craft Unions gladly comply with close local and national supervision from the Party to protect their rights from mob rule."
 CSA_collective_farming:0 "Green Fields Program"
 CSA_collective_farming_desc:0 "The Committee has approved of the Green Fields Program to the millions of acres of seized land. This is seen by the public as preferable to collectivisation, as it brings back the competitive spirit in land acquisition. This program places land that was either seized or set aside for state use to the lowest bidder who promises the highest yield."
 CSA_decentralized_planning:0 "Socialist Self-Management"
 CSA_decentralized_planning_desc:0 "The Central Committee will immediately proceed with the difficult task of creating an adequate supply of reliable technicians and managers for the industries. The scattered technical institutes, trade schools, correspondence schools, etc., will be organised, expanded and linked up directly with the industries."
 CSA_nat_syndicalist_econ:0 "Centralized Syndicalism"
 CSA_nat_syndicalist_econ_desc:0 "The Proletarian revolution initiates changes more rapid and far-reaching than any in the whole history of mankind. The hundreds of millions of workers and peasants, smashing their chains of slavery, will construct a society of liberty and intelligent prosperity. Syndicalism will inaugurate a new era for the human race, the building of a new world."
 CSA_browders_economics:0 "Browder's Economic Policy"
 CSA_browders_economics_desc:0 "Earl Russell Browder has managed to successfully introduce a series of policies meant to forge a stable, predictable economy. Built mainly on industrial plans and the direct control of several sectors of the economy by the state, through the use of commissariats and quotas. The Committee and the Craft Unions in Congress have received it well."
 CSA_price_controls:0 "Price Controls"
 CSA_price_controls_desc:0 "It is characteristic of capitalism that when its economic machinery enters a crisis, the explanation is immediately found not in lack of production, but in overproduction. We shall avoid the tragedy of burning crops we saw during the revolution through Committee-decided price limits and expropriation of unused surplus."
 CSA_control_unions:0 "Dismantle the IWW"
 CSA_control_unions_desc:0 "The IWW, though noble in concept, had the ultimate result of isolating the class-conscious workers from the leadership of the revolution, the Vanguard Party. Their continued influence threatens not only our rule, but the entire stability of new America. The true constituents of the USAS, the people, see that Vanguardism represents their interests better."

 CSA_state_quotas_desc:0 "Introducing quotas makes maximum utilisation of all the productive forces, men and machinery, and constantly raises the level of performance by the systematic application of scientific principles.

 CSA_standardize_unit_sizes_desc:0 "Our Red Guard militia forces have done well to take us this far, but their irregular numbers, often simply based on however many willing men can be found in a given town, hamper their ability in the field.

 CSA_organize_pilots:0 "Organise Pilots"
 CSA_organize_pilots_desc:0 "For some time, our aviation forces have consisted of unorganised pilots who seized their planes or got them from manufacturers directly. This has led to a situation where pilots are freely moving between different sections of the front — usually leaving our forces without air support. This practice must be stopped, and pilots must be organised into squadrons and attached to battle areas."

 CSA_continental_airforce:0 "Create the Continental Air Force"
 CSA_continental_airforce_desc:0 "Even before the Second Revolution, it was obvious that the air forces worked better if they were not tied to the ground command.

 CSA_second_continental_navy_desc:0 "Created at the start of the Second American Revolution, our navy is mostly composed of seized ships, led by ideological comrades as Admirals.

 CSA_american_air_industry_desc:0 "America is a country in which there have always been the best pilots and the largest aircraft industry in the world. Now, with the advent of the revolution, we have lost air superiority.

 CSA_caf_schools:0 "Air Force Schools"
 CSA_caf_schools_desc:0 "After the end of the civil war, we got a lot of experienced aces who can train the pilots and aces of the next generation and will create the theory of modern air war.

 CSA_continental_air_command:0 "Continental Air Command"
 CSA_continental_air_command_desc:0 "Most of our military experts propose the creation of a Continental Air Command, which will unite our air forces in a single whole. This will separate them from the army command and give more freedom in action. Although this step has its advantages, it is definitely not supported by people who consider this a return to U.S. centralisation policies."

 CSA_state_air_force:0 "State Air Forces"
 CSA_state_air_force_desc:0 "While some members of the government suggest the Air Force be subordinate to the central command - the first intention was to decentralise the Air Force and create their branches at the states' level.

 CSA_wings_of_revolution_desc:0 "In time of the Second Revolution pilots, who put their lives on the line for those who have come after them, made a great sacrifice so that the people of America will be the first in the air. Now when we have returned our aviation industry to the pre-war level and trained our pilots to mastery that can never be reached by capitalist countries, we are ready to protect workers in all parts of the world."

 CSA_states_red_guards:0 "States' Red Guards"
 CSA_states_red_guards_desc:0 "Most of our political apparatus insists on the creation of state militias who will submit to the central command only in wartime. Although the proposed plan is close to the pre-war organisation of the US Army, there is a big difference - since any militias will be subordinate only to the local state's army command - and which, in turn, will be subordinate to the central command."

 CSA_distribution_of_duties:0 "Distribution of Duties"
 CSA_distribution_of_duties_desc:0 "While our the State Army Commands will plan the battles, our central command should concentrate its efforts on planning entire campaigns, supply lines and interaction between the armies of different states.

 CSA_armies_of_states_desc:0 "After the new army reform, we decided to organise separate State Armies that will be responsible for training our soldiers, for their equipment and commanding them on the battlefields.

 CSA_american_peoples_navy_desc:0 "With the Civil War over, some politicians say that our current need is to protect the american people.

 CSA_revolution_on_high_seas_desc:0 "The old federal fleet was limited to 'naval traditions' that did not allow them to see that aircraft carriers would rule the oceans in the future. Although our oldest admirals are still inclined to the idea of 'big guns and armour', they agreed that the aircraft was very effective against enemy ships. We need to ensure that the new American Navy receives air support when it is needed in any part of the world."

 csa.1.d:0 "Today delegates have gathered from across the country in the city of Philadelphia as the Second Constitutional Convention is convened in order to draft a new and better constitution for America. Initial controversy erupts as the AFL brought their own delegation in spite of orders from the IWW to let them represent the whole of industrial labour. Other interest groups that swore allegiance to Reed have also shown up, including members of the defunct Knights of Labor and National Civic Federation. The most important of these smaller Labor Federations is the Trade Union Unity League. This organisation, represented by Earl Browder and William Foster, represent a resurgence of Vanguardism in the States. A small riot on the second day erupted when the International Peace Mission and Southern Tenant Farmers Union were ejected from the Convention. These unions had been neutral during the revolution, and were initially accepted due to their high percentage of black membership."

What was supposed to be an easy article, that of the new Legislative Branch, has drawn a line in the sand. IWW representatives argue that America should be a strictly anarcho syndicalist government with all legislative vested in the industrial trade unions. These unions seek to abolish membership fees, and elect representatives via wall-to-wall bargaining unit elections. The AFL argues that America should be a socialist state with power vested in local Councils of Professional Workers. The AFL claims representatives would be elected via seniority, with full voting rights given to only citizenry that have spent some years paying dues and serving their fellow man. TUUL Representative William Foster spoke in favour of the IWW, stating 'seniority and paying to vote is no different than graft, which is something a vanguard of syndicalism cannot support'. Foster's impassioned speech, if it leads to the IWW's legislation passing, could signal a shift in support for the TUUL over the IWW."

On one side is the IWW, whose plan for a complete anarcho-syndicalist government requires there not to be an executive officer. Their belief is that a president is an inherently reactionary populist position, and they will ensure that a person like Huey Long can never rise to power in the new America. Thomas suggests a weak head of state position. The opposition is another cooperation of the AFL and TUUL who wish for a strong face to represent America. A leader without the means, argue they, could never save America as Reed did without power. Norman Thomas has condemned the AFL for what he sees as a 'boulangist coup' perpetrated by the AFL and TUUL to revive the old federal government.

Several IWW delegates had implied that the AFL has been antagonistic, and would prefer a return to capitalism. In response, the AFL have been swayed by TUUL to emphasise the 'Dignity of Labour' in government. This argument rebukes Industrial Unionism with Craft Unionism, where the right to fair wages for fair work done replaces the IWW's goal of the abolition of wages.

The AFL have come out in force to counter that Art Deco is an American style that cannot be erased by political whims.

These protesters claim to be discriminated against based on their race by the openly anti-racist IWW. Then came the union Congressmen from the newly liberated states, who are protesting that forcing integration is a violation of their union rights to collectively bargain.

In the aftermath of this release, the planned Women's Caucus was canceled, as the nation begins to debate the ethical application of women's liberation.

[CSA.GetLeader] has taken this one step further to decry the idea of corporations, and has threatened to declare the legal concept of corporations to be illegal. The very next day, the state offices were inundated with hundreds if not thousands of formal requests to dissolve corporations into their component businesses, and applications for new Consortium's in the same breath. It is obvious to [CSA.GetLeader] that this is just a ploy for the robber barons to hide their business practices from the government, and has ordered a moratorium on reclassification until wealth redistribution is over."

It has been decided by Congress to exercise expropriation on these estates. Many of the southern and western estates have been given over to the local communes and established as public housing for the people. As expected, civilian armed resistance has cost us some lives, but few would have expected our own Red Guard to be ineffective at expropriation. One particular tough nut to crack was in Montana, where the initial militia sent in turned traitor, and held onto a large estate for its warlord owner for eight months before our Red Guard were forced to intervene.

Our more reform minded are worried that prisons will be a breeding ground for reactionary though, so workingmen should be diverted to work camps. There they will be able to pay back the state for what they stole from the people. Vanguardists believe that we have been too lenient on these traitors, and must execute the traitors of the highest standing in the prisons, as a rebellion is surely about to come.

The president has proposed the immediate complete dissolution and expropriation to the state of assets belonging to traitors in this grand conspiracy. Congress is taken aback, with most initially supporting this measure. The list of traitors, however, causes concern among certain members of the IWW and AFL.

The director, King Vidor, has been advised by colleagues to make himself scarce, as the reaction is not what he intended. Congress has demanded Vidor to release the names of those filmed, so their crimes could be properly prosecuted.

It abolishes all impediments to marriage, the biggest one being the abolition of anti-miscegenation laws. Civil marriage is now the only legal type of marriage. The code establishes no-grounds divorce, with both spouses receiving equal division of the property at the time of divorce. Also abolished is the concept of illegitimacy. Now all children are entitled to parental support and equal rights under the law.\n\nFurthermore, in accordance with the revolutionary laws regarding the family, adoption of children that were made homeless by the revolution is subsidised.

 csa.52.t:0 "Power Struggle within the ranks"
 csa.52.d:0 "William Z. Foster and Earl Browder have long viewed each other as the enemy to the people, more than just a stepping block to their own power. To Foster, Browder's economic policies will strip power from the unions and thus the proletariat. To Browder, Foster's social policies include dangerously unsocialist principles that engender to divide the proletariat by promoting Craft Unions and promoting darwinism over cooperation. As the revolution has come to an end their struggle has taken on new heights. How this shall end, is hard to say. Though some are fearing what will happen should the other be deposed."
 csa.52.a:0 "This could be bad."

 csa.53.t:0 "Foster Denounces Browder"
 csa.53.d:0 "William Z. Foster and his supporters have denounced President Earl Browder after his dissolution of the IWW - claiming that Browder’s actions as tyrannical and contradictory to the revolution. Browder and his supporters on the other hand claim that Foster is a counter-revolutionary who seeks to undermine the success of the American proletariat revolution."
 csa.53.a:0 "That traitor will be dealt with."

 csa.54.t:0 "Browder Reassigned to Europe"
 csa.54.d:0 "Following Earl Browder's denouncement of President Foster in a public speech, Earl Browder has been reassigned to a newly-created party position in Europe. This new position, as dictated by President Foster, entails Browder oversee furniture assembly and candlestick making unions that are so vital to our economy. Such an illustrious post demands that Browder not return until his year-long tenure is up. Unfortunately, communication to this international facility is spotty at times, so Browder will no longer be able to coordinate with his party allies back in America."

 csa.56.d:0 "The traitorous nature of the reactionary Browder has been discovered. Evidence has been found about how Earl Browder is working with counter-revolutionary groups abroad while at his post. Thanks to the Hall-Ballam Act, our government is not powerless to stop Browder.

Evidence displayed prominently in the papers showed secret communication between Foster, MacArthur, and Huey Long. Irrefutable testimony from Foster's emaciated family who attest to seeing Foster moving gold from the old Federal Reserve to his home. The Tribunal has declared that as such that he will be executed.

This fact, only known to [CSA.GetLeader], is perfectly covered by a fresh story in the papers about an act of revenge carried out by one of Browders disgraced former associates.

 csa.65.t:0 "Henry Wallace Testifies Against Progressives"
 csa.65.d:0 "Following the end of the Syndicalist Revolution, numerous members of the Progressive Party had pledged allegiance to the USAS in a massive show of support. While the public at large was fooled by this display, the Vanguard party is not so easily deceived. President [CSA.GetLeader] has spent the last several weeks building up a case to present to Congress purporting the inherent betrayal of Progressives to the socialist ideal. A gaunt and limping Henry Wallace appeared in a political rally today to denounce the Progressives as 'social klansmen disguised to deceive the working class.' Wallace then joined [CSA.GetLeader] in announcing that he will testify in the upcoming sedition trial against the Progressives, and they assure the public that traitors of this calibre deserved death."
 csa.65.a:0 "The revolution will be pure."

 csa.66.t:0 "Show Trials"
 csa.66.d:0 "A number of trials have been conducted of prominent politicians, who have shown reactionary tendencies, most of whom are not aligned with [CSA.GetLeader]. Counter-revolutionaries who wish to reverse the revolution have been found guilty of being the enemy of the people. The most repentant of these reactionaries are now on death row, while the stubborn few are still being pressed for information on their accomplices."

 csa.67.d:0 "The unthinkable has happened. [CSA_GetButlerOrCarlsonName] has gathered supporters among the unions and marched into [CSA_GetCapital], denouncing [CSA.GetLeader] as a tyrant and a dictator. The rest of America watches with bated breath to see what happens in [CSA_GetCapital]. [CSA.GetLeader] has responded by calling for as many allies in the military, including the Red Guards, to seize the traitorous generals before the revolution dies fighting 'another MacArthur'. The centralist forces, wearing the same uniforms as [CSA_GetButlerOrCarlson]'s forces, have engaged in a chaotic fight in the capital. Through the friendly fire and threatening mortars..."

 csa.68.t:0 "Restoring Democracy"
 csa.68.d:0 "'Americans did not fight and die in the revolution to overthrow a capitalistic dictatorship only to install a socialist dictatorship. The president, however, corrupted the revolution and tainted it. I have removed him from power, not to make myself a dictator, but to stop a tyrant. A new and free election shall be held within a year's time.' With these words on the radio from Smedley Butler, America was shocked to find that the government had been overthrown. Perhaps, however, some measure of freedom had been restored."
 csa.68.a:0 "Democracy Now, and Forever."

 csa.69.t:0 "Self Determination in the Black Belt"
 csa.69.d:0 "Before the revolution, there were plans by [CSA.GetLeader] to implement an autonomous region within the South for the African-American community. With the ascension of William Z Foster comes a dedication to the dream of creating a more perfect union, as opposed to a greater union. Foster has drafted a plan with James W. Ford to ensure the perpetual safety and self determination of African American minorities in the South. This plan is to create a Black Belt in the south of autonomous communities with their own representatives separate from Congress. While the ruling party as a whole supports this, several critics from other parties note that this policy would create an unequal standard for civil rights."
 csa.69.a:0 "Self Determination is good for all."
 csa.69.b:0 "We can't proceed without support."

 csa.70.t:0 "Reactions to the Black Belt"
 csa.70.d:0 "The African-American community is split over the Black Belt. On one hand it dramatically increased the number of black Vanguard politicians and in the country overall, as the independent communes required elected officials. On the other hand several non vanguard black politicians in the North have faced issues with promoting a colourblind society. They debate whether to continue seeking civil rights that would remove all racial differences in laws, or to expand the Black Belt northwards."
 csa.70.a:0 "We stand firm."

 csa.71.t:0 "The Great Sedition Trial of [GetYear]"
 csa.71.d:0 "Demand for food to feed the armies and citizens of a starving, war-torn Europe led many commercially-minded Southern landowners to grow corn and wheat during the years of the Weltkrieg. For nearly a decade, sales to Europe during and after the war made landowners, bankers, and commercial insurers rich, but this prosperity would not last. In 1925, the British Revolution wracked the United Kingdom, precipitating a debt crisis as scores of Britons lost their lives' savings and as even the British government went into a de-facto default, plunging the United States into the Great Depression. To make matters worse for the South, the recovery of the German agricultural sector following demobilisation caused demand for food crops to plummet even further.\n\nThe tenant farmers who had worked the land for the landowners that had profited during the high times responded by unionising during the lows. With some encouragement from Norman Thomas, sharecropper and gas-station worker Harry Leland Mitchell and his friend Clay East formed the Southern Tenants Farmers' Union in 1934, eventually coming to affiliate with the AFL-CIO. However, during the turbulent years leading up to the Revolution, many members of the STFU were taken in by Huey Long's populist rhetoric, and openly supported the America Firsters. Since the end of the Second American Civil War, the STFU has only continued to attract Longists and other seditious elements seeking to use it as a cover to legitimise their presence in the new America.\n\nToday, however, the STFU met its fate before the unions as a bailiff presented Mitchell and East to a union court on charges of sedition, high treason, and harbouring reactionaries and crypto-Longists such as Francis Townsend, one of the chief architects of Long's "Share Our Wealth" program and who was found by the CIA in Tyronza, Arkansas after East confessed to CIA agents that he had harboured Townsend and his wife at his home.\n\nPresident Browder, for his part, is said to be privately ecstatic at finally having the chance to destroy such a dangerous pocket of resistance as he turns the increasingly mighty state apparatus of the Union of Socialist American States to the task of dismantling the Southern Tenant Farmers' Union and turning their lands directly to the purposes of the state."
 csa.71.a:0 "Good riddance to bad unions!"

 csa.72.t:0 "The International Peace Movement disbanded"
 csa.72.d:0 "The revolution against capitalism drew a line in the sand. You were either with the union or a scab, that mantra worked for John Reed, but not for Earl Browder. It has come to his attention a despicable group of infiltrators into the new America in the form of the International Peace Movement. This dangerous group, led by a little man who thinks he's god, has resisted conscription and collectivisation. Their communes in New York and Philadelphia may be racially integrated, but their adherence to gender segregation in the name of a religious code is utterly reactionary. We have seized IPM members for de-programming, and their communes are now safely in the hands of Trade Union Unity League members."
 csa.72.a:0 "You're not God, little man."

 csa.73.t:0 "Foster dissolves the AFL"
 csa.73.d:0 "The Vanguard party has finally succeeded in reforming the American Federation of Labor, by dissolving it. Foster and the Central Committee were sure that labour leaders within the AFL such as John L. Lewis were dismantling the dignity of labour by adopting industrial unionist tactics. These tactics include trying to force wall-to-wall voting on trades where expertise is clearly correlated to competence and allowing new employees to outshout veterans. The tipping point was when a mail bomb was discovered near President Foster's home, which was traced back to the AFL. All other legal means to stop the AFL leaders from despoiling their craft did not work, so the Vanguard is forced to intervene directly. Lewis, among many other AFL traitors was arrested and will stand trial for their crimes against Labour."
 csa.73.a:0 "Good riddance to Lewis."

 csa.74.t:0 "Browder purges The Daily Worker of Reactionaries"
 csa.74.d:0 "After months of investigation into the editors of the Daily Worker, President Browder has called for their immediate removal. Citing numerous examples of sub-textual betrayals within the newspaper, including ghost-written opinion pieces mouthing reactionary ideas. Browder has come to Congress with a list of candidates to ensure the intellectual sanctity of the Daily Worker. This list includes University professors and metropolitan sophisticates, all pioneers in the social ramifications of Planned Economy. All were approved, and thus the mind of America is once again safe from pollution."
 csa.74.a:0 "No more crude cartoons, either."

 csa.75.t:0 "River Rouge Wildcat Strike Turns Deadly"
 csa.75.d:0 "The workshops of the River Rouge Plant have been a known hotbed for violent activity. It was there that Edsel Ford was shot by an anarchist for his betrayal of the working class, a rash action by agitated workers. It comes as no surprise that it was here where workers struck out against the United Auto Workers in a Wildcat Strike. The UAW rightly asked the Vanguard party for assistance, and boy did they deliver. After the workers were rendered inert, [CSA.GetLeader] broadcast a new policy to America banning Wildcat Strikes. No longer will mobs rule over the appointed American government."
 csa.75.a:0 "It's what Reed would have done."


### General Flavour Event

 csa.76.t:0 "Premiere of God Save King Billy"
 csa.76.d:0 "Today Charlie Chaplin has premiered another movie, titled God Save King Billy, which has quickly received glowing reviews within the press. God Save King Billy is a political satirical comedy-drama and Chaplin's first true sound film. The film follows two principal characters, an unnamed German barber struggling to make ends meet in Germany who bears a great deal of similarity with the Tramp that Chaplin played in his other movies. The other major character is King Billy, who is a cruel but ineffective buffoon of a leader; an obvious satire of Kaiser Wilhelm the 2nd. Throughout the film it shows the plight of the average German worker while viciously mocking the German government and the Kaiser in particular. The film ends with the barber being mistaken for King Billy and giving a rousing speech where he extols the virtues of Good will and Human Brotherhood and gives a strong endorsement for Chaplin's socialist views."
 csa.76.a:0 "Chaplin has outdone himself."

 csa.77.t:0 "The Catholic Workers Movement"
 csa.77.d:0 "While a good number of religious Americans have protested the effects of the revolution, that is not true for all groups. Of these groups the one that has attracted the most attention and popularity recently is the Catholic Workers Movement. Led by Comrade Dorothy Day, the movement has attracted popularity for combining Catholicism with socialist values. They focus on the concept of Works of Mercy. They have also built a number of Hospitality Houses in many major cities. The Hospitality Houses are acting as support shelters for those trying to return to civilian life, now that the revolution has come to fruition."
 csa.77.a:0 "Live in accordance with the justice and charity of Jesus Christ."

 csa.78.t:0 "Grapes of Wrath Premiere"
 csa.78.d:0 "Today, the film Grapes of Wrath premiered in theatres. The film is based on the book of the same name by acclaimed patriotic author John Steinbeck. The story follows the Joads, a family from Oklahoma and their troubles during the Depression prior to the revolution. The story illustrates the weight that federally enforced capitalism puts onto their average lives and drags their traditional values through the mud of reality. The movie does deviate from the book with the ending on a much more optimistic tone, showing the family working for the revolution overthrow their California work camp. The main protagonist Tom Joad chooses to stay with his family instead of fleeing into the night, declaring his intention to set up a Red Guard in California to reclaim his farm in Oklahoma. The film has been well regarded by both critics and the public, particularly because of the necessary edit."
 csa.78.a:0 "A film for the masses."

 csa.79.t:0 "The People's Conservation Committee"
 csa.79.d:0 "Since the 1916 National Park Service Act, Americans have been able to preserve natural splendour safe from industrialisation. Since the revolution has now been achieved, a movement has cropped up to combine this conservationism with old Progressive ideals. A number of new National Parks have been created on top of the houses of capitalism, as well as a People's Conservation Committee to guide their preservation. A top priority of the PCC is to replant trees the Midwest, the source of the dust storms that threaten our food supply. Though it took a lot of convincing to get Congress to fund this project, the PCC hopes that in a few years the dust storms that used to reach Washington D.C will only be a memory."
 csa.79.a:0 "And it puts people to work to boot."

 csa.80.t:0 "Revolutionary Memorials"
 csa.80.d:0 "With the revolution now over, countless memorials have gone up throughout the country to honour the sacrifice of the men and women that made the revolution possible. While many honour those that fought for the revolution itself, there are also ones honouring the struggles like the Haymarket Square Riot. As these memorials are made by the community, nobody was there to check whether the statue was appropriate until the press got a hold of the story. Apparently, statues were erected honouring the 1916 Preparedness Day Bombing, and the 1920 Wall Street Bombing. The press claim erroneously that the government approved of these memorials, and are honouring the bombers. These statues were silently taken down, and an official apology was forced out of the city councils responsible for this mean-spirited action."
 csa.80.a:0 "Everyone shall be honoured, unless they were bombers."

 csa.81.t:0 "Cure for Polio"
 csa.81.d:0 "Dr. Jonas Salk has created a cure for Polio. This is a miracle cure that many are calling a breakthrough in modern science. The scourge of Polio in America will now be forever gone from the minds of Americans. Parents are lining up in droves at health clinics across the country to get the vaccine for their children and themselves."
 csa.81.a:0 "Thank you, Dr. Salk."

 csa.82.t:0 "Fate of the Boy Scouts"
 csa.82.d:0 "A question has come up in regards to the Boy Scouts of America. Some within Congress regard it as a reactionary organisation, notable for including a pledge that scouts are loyal to their employers in the days before the revolution among other issues. To that end, a number within Congress believe that a new Pioneer organisation should be created, similar to the ones in socialist countries in Europe, called the Pioneers of America. Unlike the Boy Scouts, this organisation will be for both boys and girls. These Pioneers are supported by the government to help make sure that the new socialist ideas are passed down to the next generation."
 csa.82.a:0 "Leave it alone."
 csa.82.b:0 "Create the Pioneers of America."

 csa.83.t:0 "American Artists' Congress"
 csa.83.d:0 "The American Artist Congress is an organisation that has been created to unite artistic people around the country and help promote the arts within America. From traditional artwork to film-making, all are supported within the artists' congress. It quickly has become a popular organisation to show the new Avant-Garde art of the revolution. Their Chairman, Ernest Hemingway, has already begun planning for a series of patriotic publications about life during the revolution. Ernest Hemmingway's appointment to Chairman has caused some backlash from artists like John Dos Passos and John Steinbeck, who claim Ernest's politics have turned authoritarian in recent years due to his work in producing propaganda for the 1936 US election."
 csa.83.a:0 "Art for the masses."

 csa.84.t:0 "John Reed Clubs"
 csa.84.d:0 "Throughout the country a number of literature clubs called John Reed Clubs have emerged. They are to help organise writers across the country and to help to promote reading and literacy through the local communities. They focus on Socialist Literature, and in particular the corpus of John Reed's nonfiction work."
 csa.84.a:0 "Reading for Reed!"

 csa.85.t:0 "Paul Robeson Takes A World Tour"
 csa.85.d:0 "After a long hiatus from acting, socialist activist Paul Robeson is ready for a world tour. With a powerful voice and a collection of traditional African American labour music, Robeson has become the Marian Anderson of socialists in America. Just like Anderson before him, he has chosen to embark on a world tour to spread his music and support for black American rights to European theatres. The tour includes stops in London, Paris and even Florence. These European audiences, though in touch with American culture, still see black American culture as exotic."
 csa.85.a:0 "Bon voyage, Robeson."

 csa.86.t:0 "Promoting Sewer Socialism"

The principles of Sewer Socialism must be taken to the whole of the nation now that the chains of oppression have been broken.

However, people are divided as to what to do about the relief.

This lead to behaviour the old society may have deemed wrong or sinful, but our brave President Foster must look beyond traditions. For those whose souls suffered too deep an injury to carry on, we must allow them to phase out. Despite our censorship of the Daily Worker, massive protests by Christian Workers Unions, intelligentsia, and community support networks claim that Foster's 'suicide law' is merely a pretence to excuse mysterious deaths and disappearances.

The story itself is an examination of twelve Americans that lived through the depression and revolution. Passos's writing combines snippets of newspapers, propaganda, and the conversations he recalls on the streets during the terrifying months before liberation. Such an unorthodox and creative writing is usually praised by the Americans Writers Congress, but they have remained silent. This is due to the book's depiction of illegal killings that took place throughout America during the Civil War by our soldiers. Dos Passos has defended this inclusion, saying that the truth in art, as he shows it, must still exist even if it is bleak. To the nominal leader of the Writers Congress, Ernest Hemingway, this book amounted to treason and sedition against the socialist government. However, his decision to censor the book and detain Dos Passos was overruled by the Congress."

The kids will be safe on the countless fields and ranches in the pastures, making themselves useful in farm labour and running errands, living a healthy life. This frees their parents to wage revolution with all their hearts and energy. With the success of this first train, Foster has proposed to his cabinet to make this a mandatory arrangement throughout the USAS, even going so far as to propose that children be taken by force from more stubborn worker families for their own good."

Soon enough, the 501st Parachute Battalion was formed, quickly followed by other battalions and regiments. After a recruitment drive, the number of volunteers was enough to form 3 paratrooper divisions for us to utilise.

Some newspapers have already stated that “The Second Civil War did not end and became a procession of warlords,” which seriously damaged our authority, as these people fought for us in a civil war.\n\nAs if that wasn’t enough, some of the workers started protests - at least now peacefully - with demands to reduce working hours and stop mass production of weapons.\n\nIf we do not start the demobilisation program in the near future, this will only lead to the ongoing devastation of the country."

 CSA_SMEDLEY_BUTLER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L July 30, 1881, in West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L In 1898 'The Fighting Quaker' Smedley Darlington Butler lied about his age and enlisted in the Marine Corps to join the American force in the Spanish-American war. Due to his high education level he was commissioned as a second lieutenant and would be transferred to the recently captured Guantanamo following basic training. He didn't manage to see combat as his company would soon return to the US, where he was reassigned to the USS New York, becoming a first lieutenant in April 1899.\n\nHe was later transferred to the Philippines, where he mainly did garrison duty, although he took part in some engagements against the Insurrectos. In 1900, he'd accompany Littleton Walker during the Boxer Rebellion, taking part in the Battle of Tianjin and the Gaselee Expedition, being wounded in the thigh while trying to rescue a fellow marine, for which he earned a brevet promotion to captain.\n\nAfterwards, Butler would take part in the Banana wars, first in Honduras to defend the American consulate in 1903 and then in Nicaragua between 1909 and 1913, where he took part in breaking the siege of Granada, in the battle of Masaya and the capture of Coyotepe Hill. He took part in the occupation of Veracruz in Mexico in 1914, earning his first Medal of Honor in combat and was promoted to Major. He'd be transferred to Haiti, where he earned his second Medal of Honor for fighting the Caco rebellion. He'd be transferred back to the United States, where he served garrison duties until being promoted to Brigadier General in 1921. In 1927 he was sent to China to take charge of the Marine Expeditionary Force in the Legation Cities, earning his promotion to Major General, returning to America in 1929, and then competing and winning the role of Commandant of the USMC in 1931. He earned the rank of General in 1935, amidst the rising tension in the Hoover administration. When the situation started to deteriorate, Butler decided to resign from his post and presented his services to the Socialist Party, becoming the highest ranking military official to join the Red Guard and earning the rank of Field Marshal."
 CSA_EVANS_CARLSON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L February 26, 1896, in Sidney, New York, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L The son of a Congregationalist minister, Evans Carlson began his military career in 1912 when he left High School and signed up for the US Army as a private, serving in the Philippines and Hawaii, and finishing his four years of service in 1916 as a Sargeant. He then rejoined the Army right during the start of the Punitive Expedition where he took up a garrison job in Mexico. He then signed up for an officers' course, from where he graduated as a second Lieutenant in 1917, and even did a short term in the Artillery corps, becoming an Artillery Captain in 1918. However, he was unsatisfied with his army positions, so he signed up in the Marine Corps in 1922 as a private, regardless of his previous postings. He was quickly promoted to Second Lieutenant, and served in a Marine outpost in Quantico, Virginia. He then sailed towards Culebra, Puerto Rico, in 1924 and remained there five months before being ordered to the West Coast for duty with the Pacific Fleet. Applying for aviation training in 1925, he went to Pensacola, Florida, for instruction, but subsequently returned to duty with ground units. He served another tour of foreign shore duty from 1927 to 1929 at Shanghai, China. He later returned to America and was quickly sent to Nicaragua to fight against Sandino's insurgency, earning a navy cross after facing around 100 rebels with just 12 marines. He also received a commendation after the 1931 earthquake and for his work as Chief of Police of Occupied Nicaragua. He returned to the US in 1933, and was sent to Shanghai, to the Marine Detachment in the American Legation in the Legation Cities, serving as Adjutant and studying Chinese. He returned to Quantico in 1936, attending the Marine Corps Schools while also taking a course on International Law and Politics at George Washington University in Washington, D.C... As the Nation spiralled into chaos, Smedley Butler began probing the Marine Corps for signs of dissenting opinions, and quickly found an ally in Evans. When the time finally came to join the Chicago Syndicalists in their fight, even despite being severely torn, Carlson decided to follow Butler and is now one of our Highest Ranking officers, and Butler's most trusted General."
 CSA_MAURICE_ROSE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L November 26, 1899, in Middletown, Connecticut, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L Maurice Rose, born into a Jewish family, lied about his age to enlist in the Colorado National Guard in 1916 with the hopes of being able to join Pershing's Punitive Expedition to Mexico, but was discharged six weeks later for being underage. He worked with his brother in a meatpacking plant until he came of age, after which he enlisted and was selected to officer training, graduating from the Officer Candidate School in 1917 as an infantry second lieutenant. He reached the rank of Captain in 1923, and would start the Infantry Company Officer Course, graduating in 1926. With the growing schism between the pro-mechanisation officers and the traditionalists, Rose joined the former, meeting higher ranking officers like Dwight Eisenhower and George Patton, who instilled some of their theoretical armoured warfare knowledge into him. He'd undergo the Cavalry Officer Course in 1928, graduating in 1931, and then joining the Command and General Staff College, where he was still undergoing the final stages of his training when the Civil War was about to break out.\n\nRose's career had unfortunately been plagued with discrimination because of his Jewish origin, both from his commanding officers and fellow colleagues, most notably from General George Van Horn Moseley and Pedro Augusto del Valle, who are even said to have held his promotions back because of his background.\n\nAs a reaction to his treatment, Rose began to be seduced by the promises of social equality by the Socialist Party of America and when the situation finally seemed unsalvageable, Rose decided to defect northwards, where he joined the Red Guard. After having been recognised by Butler, he was promoted to the rank of General, and is widely considered the main mechanised warfare expert in the Syndicates' army\n\n§YImportant Notes:§L- He hasn't pledged his allegiance to any of the CSA political factions, and he's rumoured to only be in our army in order to fight the anti-semitic officers of the AUS who once hindered his career."
 CSA_MILTON_WOLFF_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L October 7, 1915, in Brooklyn, New York, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L Milton 'Milt' Wolff, born into a Lithuanian-Hungarian immigrant family and previously an art student, joined the Red Guard as soon as it formed. Despite holding more Vanguardist views, he was accepted into the ranks, and became quite popular amongst his peers for his leadership during the clashes against the AFP militias in late 1936 and early 1937.\n\nOnce Jack Reed announced the Revolution, it became immediately apparent there was a major lack of command staff available to the CSA, and it was in this void that Wolff was promoted to General following a vote held by his peers and colleagues who saw him as a good fit for the role. However, his ability to lead large armies has yet to be put to the test.\n§YImportant Notes:§L- Member of the Centralist Faction, aligned mostly with Browder."
 CSA_EDWARD_CARTER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L May 26, 1916, in Los Angeles, California, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L Edward Allen Carter Jr. was born to a Black American father and an East Indian mother, who shortly after his birth moved to India. With the collapse of the British Empire, and the proclamation of the Bharatiya Commune, Carter came into contact with socialism for the first time as a child, although it was short lived as his parents would move again in 1932, this time to Shanghai, where he tried to join the local American garrison, only to be rejected on account of his young age.\n\nWith the American Civil War brewing in the distance, he travelled to America as a stowaway in one of the Legation's transports, reaching Seattle and joining the local branch of the Red Guard. As their numbers discreetly mobilised eastwards to start the revolution, Carter slowly became popular amongst the soldiers, retelling the stories of bravery and revolution he had seen in his infancy in East India. When the Revolution finally started, Carter was voted in as a General, becoming the one of the only black members of the CSA staff along with Oliver Law.\n§YImportant Notes:§L- Member of the Federalist Faction."
 CSA_GEORGE_H_CANNON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L November 5, 1915, in Webster Groves, Missouri\n§YMilitary Career:§L George Ham Cannon attended the Culver Military Academy before entering the University of Michigan in 1934 to become a Mechanical Engineer. In Michigan, he joined the Reserve Officers Training Corps program, with the specific purpose of joining the Marine Corps. It was there he further developed his knowledge of warfare. However, the outbreak of the civil war disrupted his training and his studies. With many of his fellow classmates being recruited by the Syndicate Red Guards, Cannon decided to follow them into the Red Guard. As the officers were voted to fill the staff of the syndicates, Cannon was chosen as a CO of Michigan's divisions. After a short inspection of the available candidates by Smedley Butler, Butler selected Cannon personally to be promoted to General and has been trying to help the young officer perfect his Marine officer training."
 CSA_BENJAMIN_KATINE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L September 7, 1912, in Brooklyn, New York, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L Benjamin Katine, a mechanic and electrician of some renown in New York, joined the Industrial Workers of the World militias as soon as they started recruitment. Becoming popular amongst the automobile unions, he was voted as an officer in February 1937, and was chosen by the Central Staff as a general. Despite the Automotive unions backing his position, Katine still has a lot to learn before becoming a valuable general for the CSA\n§YImportant Notes:§L- Member of the Unionist Faction."
 CSA_JAMES_PATRICK_MURPHY_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L February 9, 1901, in San Francisco, California, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L James Patrick Murphy graduated from the California State University in 1926 as a Radio Engineer and moved to San Francisco. While he was unremarkable in the major unrest of the 1930s, he joined the Red Guard after the 1936 election, where his mechanical expertise with radios allowed him to connect the workers of California with those of Chicago. As the workers were discreetly mobilised into Chicago, Murphy was assigned to several cities across what now is the Syndicalist stronghold, improving radio communications between the Red Guard detachments. For his service, he was granted the rank of General within the Red Guard, but even many within the CSA General Staff doubt this Radio Engineer will be capable of leading vast armies across the American landscape."
 CSA_JOHN_TISA_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L April 6, 1914, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L John Tisa comes from a Cuban-Italian immigrant family. Previously working mostly as a factory worker and as an amateur writer in his spare time, Tisa joined the Red Guard the 31st of December, 1936. Since then, he has earned the respect of the Syndicalist soldiers in New Jersey, and was voted as their CO at their staff elections. Tisa was then promoted to general, where, for better or worse, he will have to learn from scratch the art of warfare if he hopes to come out ahead of the enemy during the revolution."
 CSA_HERBERT_HOLDRIDGE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L March 6, 1892, in Wyandotte, Michigan, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L Herbert Charles Heitke was born in a German immigrant family, and would sign up for West Point in 1913, graduating in 1917 as an infantry second lieutenant. He was first assigned to the Quartermaster Corps of the Army's Reserve in Georgia, reaching the rank of First Lieutenant in 1920 and Captain in 1923. In 1925, while he was still in the Reserve Corps, he transferred to the Cavalry corps and was assigned as Assistant Professor of History and Social Sciences at West Point. In late 1929, he was transferred to the Army's Cavalry School at Fort Riley, and remained in this position until early 1937, earning the promotion to Colonel in 1934. As soon as street violence began escalating, Heitke decided to resign and move back to New York with his family, signing up for the local Red Guard, where his military experience granted him a promotion from Smedley Butler himself. Now a General of the Syndicalist Army, Heitke has become, along with Maurice Rose and Smedley Butler, one of the few military generals of the US Army to join the revolution."
 CSA_OLIVER_LAW_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L October 23, 1900, in Texas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L Oliver Law enlisted to the US Army in 1919 as a private, serving with the 24th Infantry regiment stationed on the Mexican Border. He left the military in 1925 after being refused any kind of promotion on the basis of his skin colour, moving first to Bluffton, Indiana, where he worked at a cement plant and then shortly thereafter to Chicago where he drove a cab for the Yellow Cab Company. When the Great Depression hit, Law was left unemployed for years, until he managed to become a stevedore and joined the International Longshoremen's Association. With his savings, he tried to open a restaurant in 1932 but ultimately failed and unemployed once more, he joined the International Labor Defence. With a Civil War looming over the United States, Law was amongst the first to volunteer for the Red Guard. Because of his military background and leadership skills, he was quickly voted in as an officer by his fellow soldiers, before later reaching the rank of General thanks to the sponsoring of the National Negro Congress.\n§YImportant Notes:§L- Loyal Member of the Unionist Faction, and he is rumoured to keep close relations with both Bayard Rustin and Asa Philip Randolph."
 CSA_ROBERT_H_MERRIMAN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L November 17, 1908, in Eureka, California, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L The son of a lumberjack, Robert Hale Merriman grew up in a poor family hit hard by the Depression. Forced to take odd jobs to continue his education after graduating from high school, he ended up joining the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) branch at the University of Nevada, where he graduated in 1932, marrying his wife Marion, also a student, on their graduation day. After this, he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, to pursue a master's degree in economics. With the Depression's grip worsening in America and fascinated by French and British economic structures, he and Marion moved to Paris for a year to study at the Sorbonne. Returning to California in 1935, he finished his master's degree and was accepted to the University of Chicago's PhD program in 1936, drawn to the growing revolutionary activity in the city.\n\nAs MacArthur's deadline loomed over Reed's conference, Merriman, with his background in the ROTC, began teaching students of all ages the rudimentary military training he had learned half a decade ago. Though he was not a devoted syndicalist, Merriman was outraged by the widespread political repression and authoritarian tenancies demonstrated by the American government in the summer of 1936, and with his warm personality and commanding figure he was elected to lead the University's branch of the Red Militia.\n\nUnlike many of the other young officers voted into command by their peers, Merriman's military training and educated background made him stand out to Smedley Butler, who hand-picked the young man for higher command, and began to nurture what he saw as his strong talent for leadership and command.\n§YImportant Notes:§L-It is unclear where exactly Merriman's political loyalties lie within the greater CSA Party Congress. He has an academic interest in Syndicalist economic policy, but his distaste for authoritarianism has alienated him from the more centralist faction of the Congress lead by Browder."
 CSA_DAVID_SHOUP_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L Born December 30, 1904, in Battle Ground, Indiana, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L David Shoup was born in an impoverished family in the heart of the steel belt. From an early age, Shoup leaned politically to the left - having been moulded by the progressive ideas of Indiana politicians fighting against Wall Street's big businesses. Excelling in academics and extracurriculars such as wrestling and football, he joined the United States Marine Corps for financial reasons. In the Marine Corps, Shoup was recognised for his athletics, marksmanship, and leadership skills - impressing his commanders and subordinates for his ability to keep morale with his sense of humour. From 1927 to 1934, Shoup served in China, protecting American interests in the war-torn country, a mission he was personally opposed to seeing his actions as simply an imperialist exploitation of the Chinese people. As the nation began to spiral into chaos, Shoup's anti-imperialist stance and personal beliefs made him a staunch supporter and ally of fellow Marine Corps General Smedly Butler. When the time came for revolution, Shoup committed himself to the syndicalist cause and Butler, bringing the experience and leadership the Second Continental Army desperately needed."
 CSA_ROBERT_ALLEN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L Born July 14, 1900, in Latonia, Kentucky, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L Robert S. Allen was born Herman Greenberg until his father officially changed his name as the Weltkreig raged on to avoid connections to Germany and to pick a real \"American\" last name. Lying about his age, Allen joined Pershing's expedition to seek out Pancho Villa after which he graduated from the University of Wisconsin and took up reporting. It was in Wisconsin, one of the key hotbeds of American socialism that Allen became dedicated to Reed's cause. As racial tensions seeped into American society with the ongoing economic crisis, Allen used his investigative journaling skills to successfully infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan. A foreign correspondent with the Christian Science Monitor, Allen's dissatisfaction with the Hoover administration compelled him to write an anonymous expose "Washington Merry Go-Round." Disillusioned with MacArthur's military clique in Washington and Hoover's incompetence brought Allen more and more committed to the vision of America held by the SPA. A proponent of speed and armor due to his experiences in the Pershing Expedition, Allen has pledged himself to the worker's cause in the wake of the civil war."
