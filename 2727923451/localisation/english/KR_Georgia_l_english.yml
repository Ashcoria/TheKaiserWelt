### Leaders ###
 POLITICS_NOE_ZHORDANIA_DESC:0 "Like many of his peers, Noe Zhordania emerged from the muddled waters of Georgian nationalism and Marxism, having found a synthesis between the two. In the early 20th century he became well known as an opponent to the merger between the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party with its Georgian counterpart and as a staunch Menshevik, who was personal friends with Karl Kautsky. In 1917 he was elected chairman of the Tbilisi Soviet and denounced the Bolshevik Revolution, thereafter successfully advocating for the creation of a democratic Georgian Republic. He became its first popularly elected prime minister and from this position oriented Georgia’s foreign policy towards the German Empire, utilising his connections to German politicians in order to gain international recognition, as well as economic and military assistance. Zhordania stopped short of fully acceding to Germany’s demands that Georgia should become a monarchy under a Hohenzollern prince, which he opposed not only due to his republican beliefs, but also because he feared it would make Georgia a de-facto client state to the Kaiserreich. He supervised the creation of the Georgian constitution and forged a historic compromise between the Social Democrats and the National Democrats, to unite behind the common cause of Georgian nationalism, despite their radical ideological differences. This de-facto truce with the conservatives helped Zhordania be re-elected throughout the last 18 years, but in 1935 he announced his decision to soon step down and make room for a younger generation in the Georgian leadership. This came after a period of economic stagnation and numerous ineffectual reforms, which have cast a complicated shadow over Zhordania’s legacy."
 POLITICS_GRIGORY_GEORGIEVICH_DESC:0 ""
 POLITICS_IOSIF_BARATOV_DESC:0 "Iosif was born to the princely Baratashvili family in the village of Borbalo. Whilst studying law at the university of St. Petersburg he began to involve himself with radical student politics, and after graduating he took on a number of high profile cases as the defendant for various Georgian nationalists and revolutionaries. He helped found the Social-Federalist party and aligned himself with the Trudovik faction of the Socialist Revolutionaries, supporting them in the Duma after the revolution of 1905. He mostly sought to use the Russian parliament as a platform to raise a number of progressive issues, including Agrarianism, economic relief, combating antisemitism as well as addressing the questions of Georgian autonomy and nationalism, but he failed to gain any meaningful traction among Russia’s political elite. Following Georgia’s independence, he has emerged onto the nation’s political scene as a rather influential figure, beginning to make a career in his own right and now promoting his ideas in earnest, rather than merely petitioning powers greater than him."
 POLITICS_MIKHEIL_TSERETELI_DESC:0 ""
 POLITICS_EKVTIME_TAKAISHVILI_DESC:0 "Ekvtime was born to a family of minor Georgian nobility in the province of Guria, but was orphaned at a very early age and raised by his siblings, as well as his grandmother. Although initially known as a troublesome child, after Ekvtime went to Petrograd’s University he became recognised as an exemplary student with a passion for history and archaeology. His first foray into politics came after he became a teacher in Tbilisi and grew sympathetic to local radical student groups, whilst his passion for Georgia’s long and storied history fostered a great sense of national pride in him. After the February Revolution he signed Georgia’s declaration of independence and became a key member of the conservative National Democratic Party, fearing the growing radicalism of the Social Democratic Party. He served as Deputy Chairman of the Parliament, where he sought to defend the rights of the Georgian church and the peasants, against the growing secularism and urbanisation espoused by the Social Democrats. He is also a principled defender of public education, and an irredentist for Georgia’s historic borders. Despite his aristocratic background, he has been opposed to the influence of the nobility on Georgia’s politics but has also expressed a degree of sympathy for the idea of an apolitical, constitutional monarch who can act as a figurehead for the country. He has also defended the government's ownership of Georgia’s national treasury, preventing famous national treasures and relics from falling into the hands of private collectors."
 POLITICS_JOACHIM_VON_PREUSSEN_DESC:0 "Prince Joachim Franz Humbert of Prussia was born in Berlin, on December 17, 1890, two years into the reign of his father Wilhelm II. Like his brothers, he attended elite schools and entered military service, eventually joining the 1st Foot Guards of the Royal Prussian Army, the most prestigious regiment in the German Empire. During the Weltkrieg, he served on the eastern front, but was wounded two months into the war and immediately sent home to Berlin. After returning, Joachim became engaged to the German noblewoman Marie Auguste von Anhalt, marrying her the next year. The couple had one child, Prince Karl Franz Joseph of Prussia, presently known as the Crown Prince Ioseb of Georgia. Joachim became quite a fixation among nascent states during the Weltkrieg, he was suggested as a potential monarch in Ireland, Finland and Poland but in all three cases, he was rejected, or passed up for other candidates. In 1917 the German diplomat Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg and monarchists in the Committee of Independent Georgia sought to install Joachim as king of Georgia, but the government of Noe Zhordania vigorously opposed it. Later, the idea was revived by the conservative general Shalva Maglakelidze and the staunch germanophile Georges V. Matchabelli, who pushed for a referendum on restoring the monarchy. Joachim took the crown and adopted the regnal name Ioachim, but the foreign prince has not made many public appearances, as he is known to be struggling with learning the Georgian language and personal issues related to his mental health. He has still made token efforts to endear himself to the people, and already enjoys a great deal of support among the nobility thanks to Matchabelli."
 POLITICS_LEO_SHENGELAIA_DESC:0 "Leo was born in 1887 in the village of Obuji, in the Zugdidi region of Georgia. At an early age he sought an education in law. During his time at university he made contact with radical student groups and became a member of the Socialist Revolutionary party, becoming particularly interested in their programs for educational reform. In 1917 he formed a “Free University” with 5 other comrades, a small private school funded by the SRs, meant to educate the lower classes of Tbilisi. During his time as an administrator at the school he gained recognition for his papers on Georgia’s agrarian and labour issues, which eventually merited him a seat at the National Council of Georgia and a chance to affix his signature to the nation’s declaration of independence. Leo served within the Georgian parliament and steadily rose through the ranks of the SRs until a major schism appeared within the party in 1922, dividing the right leaning Socialist Revolutionaries from their left leaning counterparts. Leo joined the leftist politician Ivan Gobechia and assumed control of the party’s central committee, eventually being confirmed as its official leader a few years later with the left wing of the party’s and Gobechia’s support. He has thereafter served as a cautious supporter of the Social Democratic government of Georgia, unprepared to assume control of the government himself, but undaunted at the prospect of one day doing so."
 POLITICS_GIORGI_BAGRATION_DESC:0 "The tale of house Bagration-Mukhrani begins with the rise of the early 16th century prince Bagrat, who was granted the fief of Mukhrani by his brother, the King of Georgia, but eventually rose to assume a great deal of autonomous power and gained de-facto sovereignty over his fiefdom. After the Russian conquest of Georgia, the lords of House Bagration and House Bagration-Mukhrani were regarded as equally powerful, but soon the Mukhrani branch began to gain more and more support in Russian politics, especially among Georgian nationalists. The elder branch of house Bagration eventually died out, leaving the Princes of Mukhrani as the next in line to the Georgian throne. The Bagration-Mukhrani’s claim was officially recognised when the throne was won by George Bagration in the recent political referendum, restoring the Georgian monarchy. King George IX is considered a rather aloof man, with little political opinions of his own. He has been strongly influenced by his late father, Alexander, who died fighting the Bolsheviks, as well as his son Prince Irakli who is commonly considered a far more capable political schemer. This has left King George as a fairly easily manipulated figure, which frustrates much of the nobility. Nevertheless, the king is still a popular man among the common people. Even if he wasn’t invited as a signee, he gave his endorsement to the Georgian declaration of independence in 1918, and later enlisted as a soldier in the war against the Bolsheviks. It remains to be seen if this untrained, unprepared king can become a man in his own right, or if he will be defined by the influence of his son, his advisors, generals and prime minister."

It failed to gain any meaningful traction and saw heavy political repression in the aftermath of Georgia joining Germany’s sphere of influence. It is a tiny, illegal organisation that mostly meets in secret, and has begun to broaden their views to form more esoteric combinations of Communism and Georgian nationalism, noticeably adopting several elements of Western European Totalism. Some members of the party maintain ties with the Sotsialuri Revolutsionerebi, in hopes of influencing the only legal far-left party in Georgia to adopt more Communist and Totalist oriented beliefs.§!"

In the aftermath of Georgian independence, the party mellowed its views to avoid censorship and suppression, and fear of drawing ire from the German hegemon. Both the Mensheviks and SR’s in Georgia have maintained a distance from each other, never entering into an official coalition before, even if such a proposal has often been debated and discussed.§!"
 GEO_social_democrat_party:0 "SSDP"
 GEO_social_democrat_party_long:0 "Sakartvelos Sotsial-Demokratiuli Partia                   §LThe Social Democratic Party of Georgia, more commonly known as the Georgian Menshevik Party, emerged from two separate crises in the Georgian nationalist movement. In the late 19th century three groups emerged, fittingly dubbed the First, Second and Third Group, each with different ideas for how Georgian independence should be achieved. The Third Group, under the leadership of Noe Zhordania and Irakli Tsereteli embraced Marxist ideology and sought to meld Georgian nationalism with socialist beliefs. In 1903 the second crisis erupted, when the Third Group voted to join the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, despite the protests of prominent members like Noe Zhordania. This tenuous alliance did not last long, on the advent of the Russian Revolution many Georgia based members of the party decided to end their cooperation with the Russians, although some Georgians like Tsereteli remained faithful to Russian branch of the party. Zhordania emerged as the leader of the newly dubbed SSDP and helped establish an independent Georgian republic, guided by a mixture of socialism, humanism and nationalism, whilst rejecting the more extreme Bolshevik currents that had swept across the Eurasian labour movement.§!"
 GEO_social_liberal_party:0 "SSPRP"
 GEO_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Sakartvelos Sotsialist-Pederalisturi Revolutsiuri Partia §LEstablished in 1904, the Georgian Socialist-Federalist Revolutionary Party was initially derided by many of its leftist peers as a bourgeois party for the propertied class, but in time grew to appeal to both landowners and peasants, with a platform focused on agricultural issues. A critical moment emerged when the party leadership embraced violent revolutionary struggle, in line with the Socialist Revolutionaries’ “Combat Organisation”, and began to endorse expropriations and violent reprisals against unjust landowners, despite condemnation from Georgian conservatives. This won them a great deal of support from the lower classes, and helped build a coalition with left-leaning and progressive parties throughout the Russian Empire. Following the Russian Revolution, the SSPRP joined forces with the Georgian social democrats and have been in a coalition ever since, but in time their agrarian focus has caused conflicts with the more urban, labour oriented policies adopted by the social democrats. It remains to be seen if the coalition can endure these disagreements.§!"

As its current name implies, the party prioritises its political messages to appeal to large scale landowners and urban industrialists, as well as the nation’s conservative and liberal intelligentsia.

In its first few years of existence it was nearly moribund, but in 1917 Spiridon Kedia alongside the elder statesman Niko Nikoladze led a revival of the party, and participated in the first Georgian elections as well as the Georgian provisional government. The party stood for the rights of the peasants, the moderate intellectuals and the traditionalists, against what they deemed to be a tide of radical socialist ideology, sweeping across Georgia. Although unable to stem this tide, the National Democratic Party nevertheless solidified itself as the de-facto leader of the opposition against Noe Zhordania’s Mensheviks, consistently gaining more and more of an edge on him in recent elections. Following Ekvtime Takaishvili’s ascent to party chairman, the National Democrats have also sought to cultivate stronger ties with their fellow agrarian minded parties, and opened up to the possibility of cooperating with Georgian monarchists to secure power.§!"

The Georgian claimant George Bagration is ostensibly a member of the group, but the real mastermind behind the Bagration-Mukhrani dynasty’s activism is his politically savvy son, Irakli. The germanophile faction is led by the conservative general Shalva Maglakelidze and the eccentric prince Georges V. Matchabelli.

 geo.1.t:0 "The Democratic Republic of Georgia"
 geo.1.d:0 "Georgia gained its independence during the chaos of the Russian Civil War, following its break from the short-lived Transcaucasian Federation. During the chaos, Georgia went to Germany for help in defending against the enemies surrounding the nation. Georgia signed multiple agreements with Germany, notably the Treaty of Poti, placing the country under the protection of Germany in exchange for several economic concessions which have resulted in a clear German dominance within the economy. Also in the Treaty of Batum, Georgia gave all of its Muslim majority regions to the Ottoman Empire. Asserting its hard won independence, Georgia has since remained a peaceful and stable state.\n\nWhile a part of Russia, Georgia was a centre of Menshevik activity, which remained the case when it gained independence, with the Menshehvik Social Democratic Party of Georgia ruling since 1918. Following Noe Ramishvili's brief stint as Chairman in 1918, Noe Zhordania has ruled the country for 18 years solid. The Mensheviks have had complete political dominance over Georgia the whole time, though their vote count has shrunk over the years. In the election of 1935, the Mensheviks almost lost their majority, but were able to keep hold. The National Democratic Party, the EDP, garnered a large amount of votes, with their leader, Ekvtime Takaishvili beginning to work closer with monarchist groups. The popularity for a monarchy has grown over the years, with the two main candidates as king being Prince Joachim of Prussia, son of Kaiser Wilhelm II, and George Bagration, head of the old Georgian royal family, the Bagrationi Dynasty.\n\nGeorgia stands as a beacon of stability in a world of growing uncertainty. Late last year, the old and popular Noe Zhordania announced he would resign as Chairman, to be replaced by Evgeni Gegechkori, who has worked in Zhordania's government since independence, though is notably less popular than him. However, unless disaster were to suddenly strike the nation, nothing is set to change politically until the next election in 1939."
 geo.1.a:0 "Georgia must survive."

 geo.2.t:0 "Re-Examine the Treaty of Poti"
 geo.2.d:0 "The Treaty of Poti was signed with Germany when Georgia was under direct threat from most of its neighbours, and wasn't internationally recognised. This is not how things stand anymore. Georgia has strong international recognition, and though tensions grow with its neighbours, some in the country argue that protection is not worth being stuck under the German fist. People specifically point to the fact the Treaty gives Germany great control over Georgia's infrastructure, and set up a company that has great control over the Georgian mining industry. Though it would be economically beneficial in the short term, it would alienate our greatest economic partner in Germany, and set us on the anti-German path.\n\nPrince Joachim of Prussia recently announced that, should Georgia suspend the Treaty and nationalise the company, he would refuse any request to be enthroned, stating \"Georgia and Germany need each other\". On the other hand, George Bagration recently announced the opposite, that he would refuse to become monarch should Georgia stand by the Treaty, claiming \"Georgia has lived too long under the fist of Germany. Now is our only chance to stop this.\"\n\nThe foreign policy implications of the decision are massive. By sticking to the treaty, we reaffirm our loyalty to both Germany and, by connection, their strong ally the Ottoman Empire. However, if we were to end the treaty, it would allow us to act more aggressively, and take back territory that our nation claims, like Batum, currently under the control of the Ottomans."
 geo.2.a:0 "The Treaty is ended, and its company nationalised."
 geo.2.b:0 "We cannot alienate the Germans. Bail out the company."

 geo.3.t:0 "The Baku-Poti Pipeline"
 geo.3.d:0 "Over the years, since the Ottomans gained control of Batum following the Treaty of Batum, a new pipeline between Georgia and Azerbaijan was built, that being the Baku-Poti Pipeline, made specifically for the transport of oil rather than Kerosene, which is the focus of the Baku-Batum Pipeline. The Baku-Poti Pipeline was funded mostly by the Azeri government, even though a massive amount of it goes through Georgia and the trade from it happened at Poti, in our land. Some of the more nationalistic in our government have suggested that to help finish solving the Black Monday crisis, we should nationalise the Pipeline, and take its profits for ourselves. Relations between Azerbaijan and Georgia have always been tense, stemming mostly from Azeri control of Zaqatala, a city claimed by Georgia.  "

 geo.3.b:0 "No need to anger the neighbours."

 geo.4.t:0 "Georgia Has Nationalised the Baku-Poti Pipeline!"
 geo.4.d:0 "Though our relationship with Georgia has never been strong, they allowed us to invest and construct a new pipeline, the Baku-Poti Pipeline, through their territory, specifically made for transport of oil. Most of the funding for this pipeline was from our government. However, news has just reached us that the Georgian government has decided to nationalise their part of the pipeline, and take the profits for themselves! This will only boost the already tense relations between our two governments."

 geo.6.t:0 "Black Monday Hits Our Nation!"
 geo.6.d:0 "After the Berlin Stock Market crashed a few days ago, the effects have reached our country too. In a matter of a few hours, our economy was ruined, inflation is sky-high, many businesses going bankrupt and thousands of workers are being fired from their job every day. The situation is becoming worse and worse by the hour, with reports of food riots already flooding in. Though Evgeni Gegechkori has only been chairman for a few weeks, his popularity has already plummeted, and the Constituent Assembly has been in chaos, with other parties already claiming the government is not doing enough."

 geo.7.t:0 "Food Prices Skyrocketing"
 geo.7.d:0 "Since many farmers have left the countryside, and other farmers refuse to sell food cheaply, less food is available in the urban areas, and as such, prices are rising by the hour. A lot of men, women and children can't buy food anymore, because they earn too little, and as such, some have resorted to violent solutions. Shops that sell food are raided almost every day, and police presence isn't enough to stop them. Many vendors have died, and others are too scared to continue with business and have closed their doors, making the situation even worse. "

 geo.9.t:0 "Establishment of the Agricultural Goods Commission"
 geo.9.d:0 "Today the parliament has accepted the proposal to create a food pricing commission to keep prices under control and to provide food for all. Although farmers aren't going to be happy with this, it will prevent a small famine."
 geo.9.a:0 "They will do a great job"

 geo.10.t:0 "Importing Food?"
 geo.10.d:0 "Considering the current unstable situation of our agricultural economic sector, and more so because of the violent food riots that are happening in the cities, many prominent party members have proposed to temporarily import essential foodstuffs to prevent the situation becoming worse. Of course, doing this would most probably stop the food riots, but we need to keep the fact that our state debt will rise significantly if we do this into consideration."
 geo.10.a:0 "Agree with the plan"
 geo.10.b:0 "This is too risky"

 geo.11.t:0 "Food Situation Stabilises"
 geo.11.d:0 "After the government's decision to start importing food from abroad, the shops slowly started to fill again and the overwhelming majority of people is able to feed itself legally once again..."
 geo.11.a:0 "This had a price, but it's worth it"

 geo.12.t:0 "The Situation Becomes Worse!"
 geo.12.d:0 "After the government's decision not to start importing food from abroad, even less food products are available and the people are becoming more violent. We're criticised by almost every other party because of our poor judgement."
 geo.12.a:0 "This is really bad"

 geo.13.t:0 "Farmers Lower Their Prices"
 geo.13.d:0 "After the worsening of the food riots, our government reopened talks with the peasantry, this time more willing to make compromises. After many hours of debating between representatives of the SSDP and multiple farmers organisations, the two groups have reached an accord. In exchange for various pro-agrarian measures, the farmers have accepted a lowering of the prices, thus resulting in a stabilisation of the situation in the urban areas."

While some call him a puppet to the Germans, others say he's purposely working against them for personal gain. These protests have been led by multiple of parties in Georgia, everywhere from Ekvtime Takaishvili's EDP to Leo Shengelaia's SRs. Though wildly different, they all ask for the same thing: new elections. At the protests, Ekvtime Takaishvili spoke to a large crowd, about how the situation of Georgia has changed since last year, and the current government is unfit to fix it. Evgeni has not commented yet."

He has ruled the nation for 18 years, and under him Georgia has grown close to Germany, and has become a strong and relatively stable nation. However, with his popularity beginning to falter following some failed reforms and the economy stagnating, Zhordania decided it was his time to retire.\n\nHis replacement, Evgeni Gegechkori, has worked closely with Zhordania over his 18 years of leadership, serving in his cabinet at Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Justice and Minister for Internal Affairs. Due to the relative stability of Georgia at the current time, and decent economic outlooks, the public should have time to get to like Gegechkori just as much as they like Zhordania."

Protests have grown in Poti and Kutais, calling for the resignation of the government and for new elections. Worse still, George Bagration has joined the protests in Tiflis, calling for \"the end of socialism in Georgia\". Evgeni Gegechkori tried to hold a speech outside the Constituent Assembly earlier today, but protestors stopped this from happening, making Gegechkori look weaker still."

 geo.17.d:0 "The situation with the main minorities of Georgia has worsened greatly. The People's Council of Abkhazia, a council set up representing the Abkhazian people, has officially stated that the central government should call new elections. Protests have increased in Sukhum and Sochi in recent days, feeling empowered with the Council's support.\n\nThings are far worse in South Ossetia, however. Though they have been relatively peaceful since the end of the Ossetian uprisings in 1920, it seems the economic collapse has once again sparked conflict in the area. The Georgian Army have tried to keep the Ossetian revolters down, but the conflict is causing much damage to the area."

Protests continue in Tiflis and across the country, and some industries are talking of strikes against the government. The opposing parties in the Constituent Assembly, led in opposition by Ekvtime Takaishvili, continue to call on the government to resign and for new elections. What is even more worrying, though, is the growth of resistance against Gegechkori by his own party. Multiple cabinet ministers are beginning to speak of how new elections might be best to try to preserve whats left of Georgian stability."

Construction projects to repair the damage caused by the protests have already begun, as have the campaigns of the political parties.\n\nThe minor parties, the SSPRP, the SR, and the MMEP, are not likely to achieve anywhere close to a majority, and are instead potentially options for coalitions in a possible minority government. The key parties campaigns are the SSDP and the EDP.\n\nGegechkori and the SSDP are running on a continuation of the current system and government, talking about the success Georgia has achieved in the past 18 years. The EDP, on the other hand, are campaigning on the failures of the current government, primarily the failures of the government to quickly deal with the Black Monday crisis. The EDP are also picking up votes with monarchists, after Ekvtime Takaishvili promised that if the EDP win the election, they will hold a referendum on the monarchy."

To the left of the SSDP are the Georgian SR, a radical party focused on agrarian socialism and the idea of land socialisation, or the division of land to peasant tenants. Though neither party will come close enough to forming a government, their growing popularity along with the SSDP's weakness means its all but assured the SSDP will be forced to form a coalition with one of these parties."

On the left, many people, some even former Bolshevik supporters, are beginning to support the SR more and more. On the right, some who believe the EDP do not go far enough are beginning to support the Patriotic Union Tetri Giorgi, a right-wing nationalist party led by former general Leo Kereselidze and professor Mikheil Tsereteli.

A strong right winger who had always been highly suspicious of the Menshevik Government, he helped found the Tetri Giorgi, a right wing anti-socialist and anti-syndicalist nationalist organisation. Though the group itself is minor, many of its politicians, including its leader Leo Kereselidze and especially Shalva Maglakelidze, are very popular in Georgia, and helped push the idea of monarchism to the forefront of Georgian politics.\n\nToday, the organisation is holding a pro-monarchist rally in Tiflis, attended by thousands of Georgian citizens. It started off peaceful, though throughout the day more and more counter protesters, mostly coming from left wing parties and groups, began to join against the Tetri Giorgi rally. Following a few light clashes between the socialists and monarchists, the police were forced to step in to try to split the groups. However, both sides saw it as the police trying to suppress their side, and so the violence got worse, leading to large brawls between socialists, monarchists and police. By the end of the day, there were many injuries and much damage was done to the city, though thankfully no one died."

In his speech in Tiflis, Gegechkori discussed how the creation of a Kingdom would undo any progress done by socialism in Georgia, and that any true socialist should be diametrically opposed to the monarchist campaign.

Later he discusses his wife Marie and son Karl, and the massive change in their life living in Georgia was. He even discusses his own mental health and struggles with the Georgian language. When asked if it was the right time for Georgia to become a monarchy, with tensions in the world growing, Joachim asserted that this was the best time for it. He claimed that the monarchy can be a point of stability following months of political chaos, and his connections to the Germans allows Georgia to grow closer to the world hegemon.\n\nThough some see Joachim's poor mental health and struggling with the Georgian language as weak, most of the country is sympathetic, and like the honesty and boldness for him to discuss this.

He talks about his history of involvement in Georgia and struggles for the Georgian cause, including his fighting against the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War. On the issue of politics, George discussed how the monarchy should be an apolitical body in the country, and stated his son Irakli was more political, to which he agreed. Irakli went on to say how the monarchy should act as a point of stability in the country, and should be able to \"correct the course of the country should it go too far\".\n\nThough George himself came off quite well in the interview, controversy has started over the comments of his son. His statement about \"correcting the course\" has been seen by many as an affront to democracy, and they claim that Irakli does not really want a constitutional monarchy, just more power. Still, George remains quite popular, especially within right-wing circles, who venerate George's military experience against the Bolsheviks and in many ways agree with the statements of his son."

Now, the day after the referendum, thousands of people have flocked to the streets of Tiflis to protest against the fact that their country has been turned into a kingdom. Fiery speeches by Zhordania caused the crowd to begin to turn violent, with some vandalism and clashes with police taking place later into the day. There were even rumours that Valiko Jugheli, a prominant member of the SSDP who is also a general of the country, was in Tiflis supporting the protestors.

He also earlier that day resigned his post as a general in the army.

Cholokashvili spoke vaguely about his plans, talking about \"protecting Georgia\" and \"temporarily taking control\" but it was clear what he was suggesting: a coup. Cholokashvili said he had certain areas of the army on his side, and he could quickly move into Tiflis, remove the current government and secure the city. From there, Georgia would still be under external threat, and so his new administration should remain in power for the foreseeable future. Cholokashvili also states that he has civilian support from the highly nationalistic Tetri Giorgi. Cholokashvili is suggesting a strange mix of absolute monarchy, military dictatorship and nationalists autocracy, a coalition between the monarchy, the military and the Tetri Giorgi. A plan like this could end democracy in Georgia forever. It is George and Irakli's decision as to whether Cholokashvili moves forward with the plan."

By the time Prime Minister Ekvtime Takaishvili was awake, it was already too late, as the government was already under Cholokashvili's control.

However, signs are beginning to show that the chaos might be coming to an end. More and more people are beginning to leave the protests and return to work, accepting the fact their country is now a monarchy. Though many radicals joined Jugheli's People's Guard, not many of them actually showed up to fight in Tiflis, most likely not willing to risk their lives to fight for a result which most of the country voted for. It seems we might have gotten past the peak of the anti-monarchist protests."

Jugheli has control of the city, after defeating the small garrison there. To take back the city, we have 2 options. The Rioni river runs directly through the city, and we have control of it slightly up stream. One of our officers suggested we send a small group of our elite troops down the river in rafts into the city, as a sneak attack. However, many in the military believe that a small group of troops will not be enough, and that the best course of action is to march a large army into the city, to fight the People's Guard garrison head on, and defeat them with superior numbers and weapons. In regard to the river plan, there are also worries that if the weather deteriorates, our troops will be unable to control their rafts, and will be unorganised and easily repelled."

However, as they sailed down the river, a storm rolled in, and the river became violent. Some men's rafts were damaged or even destroyed, while others were beached. By the time they reached the city, they were unorganised, and some of their equipment and weapons were damaged by the water and harsh conditions. The People's Guard garrison in the city was easily able to pick off and defeat our troops. This is a major defeat for the government."

 geo.42.a:0 "Excellent."

 geo.43.t:0 "Siege of Sukhum"
 geo.43.d:0 "Next comes the question of taking the city of Sukhum, the capital of the region of Abkhazia. The People's Guard has a relatively strong presence in the city, and the people are unlikely to cooperate with government forces much. Plans to take the city have been brought forward by multiple different officers. The city is a major port on the Black Sea, and there are many ships in the port currently. Some officers suggest that our forces should focus on taking the port first, then move into the city itself, to stop the People's Guard troops from retreating out of the city. However, other officers have said that this is too risky, and that cornering the People's Guard inside the city will force our troops to fight all their forces at once to their deaths. However, if we allow the People's Guard the opportunity to retreat, they will fight less vigorously and will be quick to retreat. Most of our officers agree with the plan to take the city itself first, instead of the port."

 geo.45.d:0 "The siege of Sukhum looked like it was going perfectly, as our troops moved in from the east and quickly took control of the port. However, as our troops pushed further into the city, they faced extremely harsh resistance from the People's Guard. Our troops got around halfway through the city before they were forced back due to the sheer resistance from the People's Guard. As time went on, our troops got pushed further and further back, eventually being pushed back all the way to the port. The People's Guard pushed back harder and harder, and eventually our forces were forced to retreat in the boats in the port. Sukhum seems to be under Jugheli's control."

 geo.46.d:0 "A small battle still rages at the port city of Poti in the west. Our forces control the city for now, but there are regular skirmishes from the People's Guard, and a large force is amassing just outside the city to take it. We must get troops to Poti as quickly as possible. We have some leftover troops from Sukhum, but it will take a while to organise them and send them down. In contrast, we have some troops further up the Caucasian Railway, which ends in Poti. Many of our officers are suggesting we send our troops down it to reach Poti in time and lift the siege."

Comparatively, government troops were under-supplied and lacked morale. Many of them even defected to the People's Guard before the battle began. After a few hours of battle, the government forces were defeated, and Jugheli's troops marched into Tiflis, and he took over the government. Kakutsa Cholokashvili, George Bagration and his son Irakli were arrested. In a speech outside parliament, Jugheli declared Georgia a republic once more, and that he would lead a coalition of the SSDP, SR and SSPRP until proper elections can be held."

Primarily, the question focuses on Kakutsa Cholokashvili, George Bagration and his son Irakli. Of course they must be punished, their crimes are treason against Georgia. However, some argue that it would be best to only lightly punish them, by putting them under house arrest. This will show how our administration is willing to be forgiving, and that we are not fighting for revenge, but for the betterment of the country."

Though they were not the most well trained troops, they showed true support for key Georgian values, like democracy and republicanism. The process has now started to integrate these troops into the army itself, to help dilute Cholokashvili's supporters and end another potential dictatorship, should another arise."
 geo.53.a:0 "They fought well."

 geo.54.t:0 "Strengthen Political Institutions"
 geo.54.d:0 "Now, Valiko Jugheli has declared it time to reinforce the political institutions of the country, to try and avoid another monarchist dictatorship. Firstly, he passed a law that stated Georgia would always be a republic, to give the monarchy no chance of taking power once again. The Constitution of 1919, a work of constitutional art, was reviewed, but was decided it still worked and was not the reason Cholokashvili and Bagration were able to take over. Jugheli instead blames the courts made to defend the constitution. He dismissed any judges that tried to give Cholokashvili's regime legitimacy, and emphasised it is the courts that must protect the political institutions of Georgia."
 geo.54.a:0 "Georgia will always be a republic!"

 geo.55.t:0 "Jugheli Announces New Elections"
 geo.55.d:0 "Today, in a speech outside parliament, Valiko Jugheli announced to a large crowd of people that new elections would be held in a months time. He claimed that the EDP, by allowing the referendum, was partly responsible for the dictatorial takeover, and therefore the people deserve to vote once again on a new parliament. The announcement was met with cheering by the crowd, happy to see that democracy was once again going to take place in the country."

To secure their independence in the turbulent times of the Russian Revolution, the Georgian government signed the Treaty of Poti, a treaty that gave Germany vast economic power in the country. In the wake of the Black Monday crisis and the collapse of the Georgian economy, Georgia has decided to declare the Treaty of Poti at an end, and has instead decided to take an anti-German stance, using nationalism to gather support for their government. Some of the more jingoistic in their government have even discussed retaking Batum from us."

King George's son, Prince Irakli, assisted in the coup, and is far more politically active and able than his father. He will become Foreign Minister. Shalva Maglakelidze is a retired general, now one of the most popular of the Tetri Giorgi. A Germanophile and extreme nationalist, he wants the role of Minister of the Interior, but it was decided he is far too ideological for the position. Better off to put him in a high level position where he cannot too heavily influence the ideology of the government. Therefore, he will become the Economy Minister. Leo Kereselidze is another ex-general, who led the Georgian Legion in the First Weltkrieg. Leader of the Tetri Giorgi, it is decided he will become Minister of the Interior."

 geo.61.d:0 "During the First Weltkrieg, we helped secure Georgia as an ally in the Caucasus. Their government has remained friendly to ours since their independence, and now, with international order under threat, they have requested to join our alliance."
 geo.61.a:0 "Welcome to the Reichspakt."
 geo.61.b:0 "We decline."

 geo.62.t:0 "Germany Has Accepted!"
 geo.62.d:0 "Germany has accepted our request to join the Reichspakt"
 geo.62.a:0 "Excellent."

 geo.63.t:0 "Germany Has Declined!"
 geo.63.d:0 "Germany has declined our request to join the Reichspakt"
 geo.63.a:0 "Damn."

 geo.67.t:0 "Elections to the People's Council of Abkhazia"
 geo.67.d:0 "The People's Council of Abkhazia, the devolved body established in the early days of the republic to represent the Abkhaz people, has recently held it local elections across the Abkhazia region. The establishment of the People's Council allowed the Abkhaz people to not feel intimidated or threatened by the central government, and to give them a voice in their region. The elections took place without a hitch, with more left-wing nationalist groups gaining control of the council."
 geo.67.a:0 "Democracy is good."

 geo.68.t:0 "Autonomy Question for South Ossetia"
 geo.68.d:0 "With the elections to the People's Council of Abkhazia a few weeks ago, people in the region of South Ossetia have begun to ask themselves why they do not have their own devolved body. Following the South Ossetian uprisings that ended in 1920, the region of South Ossetia had been relatively peaceful, and self determination for the South Ossetian people faded to an obscure idea only held by intellectual circles. However, following the economic and subsequent political disasters in 1936, tensions once again flared up in the region, and with many remembering the violence of the early days of the republic, a military detachment was sent to the region all the way until the election. Now that the people of Abkhazia have exercised their local democracy, the question that is beginning to enter the mainstream is whether the South Ossetian people deserve the same."
 geo.68.a:0 "Hopefully this is settled peacefully."

 geo.69.t:0 "South Ossetia Autonomy March in Tskhinvali"
 geo.69.d:0 "The minor groups that have been fighting for South Ossetian autonomy seem to have finally broken into the mainstream, with mass support for a pro-autonomy march that has taken place in Tskhinvali, the capital of the South Ossetian region. Though there was no violence between protesters and police, there are fears that if demonstrations like this continue, more extremist elements of this movement might enter the mainstream."
 geo.69.a:0 "Oh dear..."

 geo.70.t:0 "People's Council of Abkhazia Endorses South Ossetian Autonomy"
 geo.70.d:0 "The left-wing controlled People's Council of Abkhazia has officially announced that they, and therefore the Abkhazian region they represent, endorse the idea of a devolved body for the people of South Ossetia. It has become clear that this is something that we cannot ignore, and many in government demand a response, lest the unrest in the South Ossetian region grow."
 geo.70.a:0 "Establish a People's Council of South Ossetia."
 geo.70.b:0 "We cannot be pressured into this."

 geo.71.t:0 "People's Council of South Ossetia Established"
 geo.71.d:0 "Final preparations have been made, and a new People's Council of South Ossetia has been established, to represent the people of South Ossetia. A provisional government has been appointed until official elections to the council can take place. Protests in the region have ceased, and though there are still some calling for all out independence, it is limited to intellectual circles, and the masses are generally content."
 geo.71.a:0 "Thank goodness."

 geo.72.t:0 "South Ossetians Begin to Arm Themselves"
 geo.72.d:0 "After being endorsed by the People's Council of Abkhazia, many South Ossetians assumed that autonomy was on the way. When this desire for autonomy was rejected by our government, many have instead come to the conclusion that a crackdown in the region was on the way. Therefore, many South Ossetians in the region, remembering the multiple conflicts that have occurred in the region, have begun to arm themselves with weapons smuggled in from the north. There is still a chance to end any danger of conflict if autonomy for the region is announced. Instead, it'd be a good idea to increase the military presence there."
 geo.72.a:0 "Increase military presence."
 geo.72.b:0 "No need for bloodshed, establish a People's Council of South Ossetia."

 geo.73.t:0 "Military Police Kill Three Protesters"
 geo.73.d:0 "Following further protests across the South Ossetia region, military police were forced to establish a permanent presence there. After a few hours of protests in Tskhinvali, a fire was started, which, after being blamed on the protesters, led to clashes between military police and protesters. The situation quickly deteriorated, and a riot quickly broke out. During clashes throughout the night, many people were injured, and three rioters were killed. With news of the deaths spreading across the South Ossetian region, tensions have flared, and we should expect a reaction from the people."
 geo.73.a:0 "Guess this can't be solved peacefully..."

 geo.74.t:0 "South Ossetian Rebels Attack Military Base"
 geo.74.d:0 "Following the deaths of protesters a few days ago, a group of disorganised South Ossetian rebels have gathered together and attacked a military base near the northern border. Though the military presence there was able to quickly pacify the attackers, it led to the deaths of 13 South Ossetians and 4 Georgian troops. It is clear that something drastic must be done to defuse the situation. We could finally give in to the South Ossetians demands for autonomy, or crack down on them hard, to finally crush any desire for autonomy by force."
 geo.74.a:0 "Its time to give in and establish autonomy for them."
 geo.74.b:0 "Crack down hard militarily."

 geo.75.t:0 "Military Crackdown in South Ossetia"
 geo.75.d:0 "Following tensions flaring in the South Ossetian region, the military has been sent in to crush any further resistance in the area. Many of the ringleaders of the protests and riots have been arrested, and the protests have been broken up by force. Though there have been clashes with rebels, they have quickly been put down by the military. South Ossetia is secure."
 geo.75.a:0 "Excellent."




 geo.120.t:0 "1936 Election"
 geo.120.d:0 "Following the chaos caused by Black Monday and the failures of the SSDP government, Evgeni Gegechkori was forced to call a new election, a election he knew he was likely to lose. Today, with people going out to the polls, it looks like it'll be close, with no party able to get a sole majority. It is likely the EDP-MMEP coalition will win overall, though it might be possible for the SSDP to scrape a minority victory."
 geo.120.a:0 "The Menshevik SSDP survive with a minority."

 geo.121.t:0 "The SSDP Coalition Question"
 geo.121.d:0 "Though the SSDP was victorious in the election, no party has enough seats to form a majority government. Therefore, a coalition is necessary. One can either be formed with the federalist, nationalist and decentralist SSPRP, or the radically socialist SR. Both parties have made clear they are open to a coalition."
 geo.121.a:0 "Form a coalition government with the SSPRP."
