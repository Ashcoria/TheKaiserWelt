 part.571.t:0 "Control over the North German Federation"
 part.571.d:0 "Our armies having fought valiantly to overcome the threat of the German Empire and our intensive participation in the war make ourselves worth of occupying a part of the former German empire and guiding its people towards Syndicalism."

 part.572.t:0 "Control over Prussia"
 part.572.d:0 "Our armies having fought valiantly to overcome the threat of the German Empire and our intensive participation in the war make ourselves worth of occupying a part of the former German empire and guiding its people towards Syndicalism."

 part.62.t:0 "Restoration of the [GBP.GetAdjective] Throne?"
 part.62_britain.d:0 "With the Union of Britain thoroughly defeated, the time has come to establish a new administration for the isles. The most natural choice to much of the country is to reestablish a monarchy with Carl Eduard of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha on the throne. Though it could be a wiser choice to install a puppet republic than the so-called 'traitor prince'. Eduard himself is open to the position and has previously expressed an interest in taking the throne though loyal elements within the country have sometimes referred to him as a liability and his mere presence could badly antagonise the British."
 part.62_england.d:0 "With England under our control, it has been decided to create a new independent English nation and loyal member of the Reichspakt. Carl Eduard, the so-called 'traitor prince' is the obvious candidate for the restored throne, now parted from its holdings, but it has been proposed it may be better to establish a republic with loyal collaborationists instead. Regardless England shall raise its fist against the Vaterland no more!"
 part.62.a:0 "A German king shall sit on St. Edward's Throne!"
 part.62.b:0 "Look what they did to the last king, a republic is more preferable."

 part.63.t:0 "The Government of Scotland"
 part.63.d:0 "With the decision to establish a new independent Scottish nation, we must now decide on how it shall be governed. Establishing a puppet republic would ensure a more orderly transition of power and would be more amicable to the Scots themselves. However, we have been approached by some figures of the fledgling nationalist movement to instead reestablish the Jacobite monarchy to give some international prestige to the country and give it a cultural icon though this would not be a particularly popular move in Scotland itself.\n\nKing Rupprecht of Bavaria has repeatedly ruled out any interest in the Jacobite claim, going as far as to publicly ask the Scots in 1928 to not campaign on his behalf though his younger brother Franz may be more amicable to the position."
 part.63.a:0 "Scotland shall be bound by blood!"
 part.63.b:0 "A puppet republic is better."

 part.64.t:0 "The Government of Wales"
 part.64.d:0 "For sometime now the disparate forces of the Welsh Home Rule Army led by Saunders Lewis and Huw Robert Jones, along with other paramilitary groups have worked to chip away at British authority within Wales. Fortunately their efforts have bore fruit and now they are widely regarded as the most suitable candidates to lead the new collaborationist government, at least in the interim under a proper administration can be established. Envoys from the Heer have met with the Welsh Army Council in Colwyn Bay to sign the new government into place along with formalising the creation of a Provisional Legislative Committee to handle, at least nominally, the interim government. Wales will now serve as a loyal member of the Reichspakt."
 part.64.a:0 "Excellent!"

 part.65.t:0 "A Little Gift from Zim"
 part.65.d:0 "Not really sure how you got here but to whoever's playing their puppets, here's a little top up on the old manpower, guns and factories. Enjoy being a German lackey."
 part.65.a:0 "I promise I will!"

 part.66.t:0 "Another Little Gift from Zim"
 part.66.d:0 "... Uh you're not supposed to see this."

 part.67.t:0 "Hidden Event #3"
 part.67.d:0 "...\n\nAre you seriously playing puppet Wales?"
