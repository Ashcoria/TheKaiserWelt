### Focuses ###
 GRE_black_monday_focus:0 "Black Monday"
 GRE_black_monday_focus_desc:0 "The Black Monday crisis has hit the Greek economy like a bull in a china shop, considering its domination by German businesses. It is time to take drastic action to resolve this crisis before it gets any worse."
 GRE_farming_crisis:0 "The Farming Crisis"
 GRE_farming_crisis_desc:0 "While the Greek economy saw strong industrial growth through the 19th century, it remains primarily orientated on agriculture, and thus the sudden drop in agricultural exports has hit the country hard. Farmers are nearly at a point of rioting, so addressing this crisis tops our agenda."
 GRE_foreign_industry_question:0 "Foreign-Owned Industries?"
 GRE_foreign_industry_question_desc:0 "Much of Greece's industry is owned by foreigners, mainly in Germany and Austria. With the financial crisis, many of these factories have begun to shut their doors, expecting Greece to deal with the political fallout until such a time as the economy recovers. With so many industrial workers left unpaid and out on the street, we must do something about this."
 GRE_board_of_industry:0 "The Board of Industry"
 GRE_board_of_industry_desc:0 "A new government agency must be created in order to oversee an overhaul of some of Greece's rather outdated industrial laws and practices."
 GRE_greek_mining:0 "Advancements in Mining"
 GRE_greek_mining_desc:0 "Much of our country's mining equipment and methods are rather old, sometimes dating back to the mid-19th century. We should encourage companies to update their equipment and research, in order to increase production."
 GRE_greek_rail:0 "Greek Railways"
 GRE_greek_rail_desc:0 "A program to build new railways connecting Athens to the northern part of the country will not only enhance our overall infrastructure, it will create a much-needed employment program for our industrial workers who are currently unemployed."
 GRE_land_reform:0 "Begin Land Reform"
 GRE_land_reform_desc:0 "Many of the country's agricultural communes are still overseen by wealthy landlords, with the peasants treated practically as serfs. While breaking up these holdings will be costly, it's the only way to see the farms increase their efficiency and bring us into the 20th century."
 GRE_privatize_industry:0 "Privatise Government Holdings"
 GRE_privatize_industry_desc:0 "There are a number of government-run businesses and factories which would best work in the hands of private individuals. They should be sold off to Greeks of means and expertise, even on the cheap, in order to diversify their portfolios and ensure that loyal citizens are enriched."
 GRE_nationalize_industry:0 "Nationalise Vital Companies"
 GRE_nationalize_industry_desc:0 "Too many vital industries are ready to go bankrupt. Only the nation's government is organised and efficient enough to keep them afloat, at least until the crisis is passed and, in the meantime, they can keep the economy afloat and Greeks employed."
 GRE_military_conversion:0 "Convert Military Factories"
 GRE_military_conversion_desc:0 "There are a number of military factories which we must consider turning over to commercial use. It means Greece will be less prepared for war in the future, but there will be no Greece if it crumbles around us thanks to the crisis."
 GRE_fund_business:0 "Take Out Loans"
 GRE_fund_business_desc:0 "We cannot dig any deeper - the only way to bail Greece out of this crisis is to take out as many loans as we can afford, and channel that money into employment programs and funding the most promising companies willing to open new factories in Greece. It will hurt in the long run, but we have little choice."
 GRE_recovery:0 "Full Recovery"
 GRE_recovery_desc:0 "Our stimulus programs have begun to improve the economic prospects of the country for now, and the crisis is passed. Hopefully, the price we paid does not come back to haunt us."

 GRE_monarchy_referendum:0 "Referendum on the Monarchy"
 GRE_monarchy_referendum_desc:0 "The legacy of the Greek monarchy still hangs over the republican government. Calls for a public referendum to determine if a monarchy should be restored for the stability of the nation, or if the republic should instead persist."
 GRE_republican_victory:0 "Republican Victory"
 GRE_republican_victory_desc:0 "There is to be no king. The question was settled today, with the vote to maintain the republic and continue into the future untethered to dynasties and successions."
 GRE_strengthen_republic:0 "Strengthen the Republic"
 GRE_strengthen_republic_desc:0 "The republic may have won the day, but monarchists still remain. By taking steps to reform the legal system and remove any and all remnants of monarchy from official proceedings we can move towards the permanent establishment of a republican nation."
 GRE_monarchist_question:0 "The Remaining Monarchists"
 GRE_monarchist_question_desc:0 "There are still many within the government, and especially the army, who yet hold loyalties to the monarchy. We must consider whether to purge them now, to prevent the possibility of a future coup, or to let them remain and potentially disrupt the republic's operation."
 #GRE_empowered_parliament:0 "An Empowered Parliament" already defined above as an idea
 GRE_empowered_parliament_desc:0 "In order to ensure that strongmen and dictators cannot exploit the system, the Greek nation must have a strong parliament capable of controlling the head of state, if necessary."
 #GRE_strong_executive:0 "A Strong Executive" already defined above as an idea
 GRE_strong_executive_desc:0 "In order to ensure that political infighting does not bring us down, the Greek nation must have a strong head of state who can overrule parliament, if necessary."
 GRE_balkan_democracy:0 "Balkan Democracy"
 GRE_balkan_democracy_desc:0 "Greece is a bastion of democracy in the Balkans, and must shine like a beacon of freedom for all to see."
 GRE_monarchist_victory:0 "Monarchist Victory"
 GRE_monarchist_victory_desc:0 "The kingdom shall be restored! Today the debate was settled, though now talk has turned to which king it should be: the younger Alexander, who was king before his exile, or the older George, who should have been king before Alexander and only was not due to being exiled with his father years before."
 GRE_king_alexandros:0 "King Aléxandros"
 GRE_king_alexandros_desc:0 "First crowned in 1917 and later exiled, King Alexander shall be returned to the throne. A moderate man used to being a figurehead, he shall serve as a constitutional monarch with only the minimum of formal powers."
 GRE_republican_question:0 "The Remaining Republicans"
 GRE_republican_question_desc:0 "With the king now back on the throne, a question lingers regarding what should be done with those who most oppose him and advocate a return to republican rule. The king advocates mercy, but would that only leave Greece to the possibility of more coups in the future?"
 GRE_empower_the_throne:0 "Empower the Throne"
 GRE_empower_the_throne_desc:0 "It seems Alexander has learned a thing or two in his exile and has been exerting his will on parliament more forcefully. He has garnered enough support to gain power enough to overrule the elected leaders when needed, making him far from the figurehead many assumed he would be."
 GRE_king_georgios:0 "King Geórgios"
 GRE_king_georgios_desc:0 "A military man from an early age, Prince George is the eldest son of the late King Constantine and shall create a strong monarchy along German lines, where the King serves as a brake on the powers of parliament."
 GRE_purge_republicans:0 "Purge Republicans"
 GRE_purge_republicans_desc:0 "A new king is on the throne, and his wishes are clear: those who yet harbour republican sentiment must be purged from the government and the army, lest the country fall into disorder once again."
 GRE_guide_parliament:0 "Guide Parliament"
 GRE_guide_parliament_desc:0 "We must support the great Greek tradition of democracy, but like Plato's Philosopher King the monarch must always be there to guide the nation towards a more perfect and peaceful society. By granting the monarch significant royal prerogatives to dissolve parliament as he wishes we can ensure that it is always well lead."
 #GRE_divine_mediator:0 "A Divine Mediator" already defined above as an idea
 GRE_divine_mediator_desc:0 "The king stands as a divinely anointed ruler, chosen by both God and the people to defend them from radicalism and instability. By mediating between all branches of government he can ensure that his will is followed, the dignity of the state is preserved and the people's needs can be made known to him."

 GRE_elections_1938:0 "1938 Elections"
 GRE_elections_1938_desc:0 "The elections of 1938 are promising to be most interesting, and as is typical for Greece it appears that many outcomes are possible."
 GRE_soc_liberals:0 "Néa Fileléftheri Énosi"

 GRE_industrialization_program:0 "Industrialisation Program"

 GRE_market_liberals:0 "Fileléfthero Kómma"
 GRE_market_liberals_desc:0 "The more market-oriented elements of the Liberal party have won, and intend to begin at once a programme of economic liberalisation intended to stimulate trade and economic growth."
 GRE_free_market_reforms:0 "Free Market Reforms"
 GRE_free_market_reforms_desc:0 "The Greek economy must be liberalised and unnecessary restrictions on trade and business torn up in order to facilitate social progress in Greece. After all the freer the market..."
 GRE_free_trade:0 "Free Trade"
 GRE_free_trade_desc:0 "We intend to abolish all tariffs and pursue a policy of free trade wherever we can, in order that we might be free to do good business with all the world."
 GRE_liberalization:0 "Political Liberalisation"
 GRE_liberalization_desc:0 "Freedom of speech, the press, and of association are all to be protected more firmly under a raft of reforms we intend to pass in order to improve the lot of the average Greek. A free and open society will be established."
 GRE_education_programs:0 "Educational Programs"
 GRE_education_programs_desc:0 "Improving the literacy rate of the Greek population is of paramount importance, as is broadening the quality of education in general. We intend to found hundreds of new schools for this purpose, where the keen minds of new generations will thrive."
 GRE_neuter_military:0 "Neuter Military"
 GRE_neuter_military_desc:0 "By far the biggest threat to stability in Greece comes from the military, while we accept the need for the armed forces we must take steps to ensure their political neutrality and remove overly ambitious demagogues from the ranks."
 GRE_strong_and_free:0 "Strong and Free"
 GRE_strong_and_free_desc:0 "It may not always be wise to give power to the military, lest they abuse it, but without our army's strength we will never truly be independent. We must empower them and keep Greece both strong and free."
 GRE_progressive_greece:0 "A Progressive Greece"
 GRE_progressive_greece_desc:0 "The Greek people have embraced a brighter, more liberal future that believes in social progress and the rights of man. We are Greeks, proud and indivisible as equals."

 GRE_soc_conservatives:0 "Laïkó Kómma"
 GRE_soc_conservatives_desc:0 "The more moderate Peoples' Party seems to have come out on top in the coalition negotiations. While they are likely to reverse secular reforms, they are not as fervently anti-union and will support those based around Christian principles and leadership."
 GRE_christian_unions:0 "Found Christian Unions"
 GRE_christian_unions_desc:0 "Founding state-endorsed unions under the leadership of priests will allow us to prevent labour disputes from getting out of hand and becoming a threat to the safety of Greece. Workers will be able to express their wants and concerns to the clergy, who will serve as negotiators on their behalf."
 GRE_export_focus:0 "Export-Oriented Economy"
 GRE_export_focus_desc:0 "The Greek economy would be best served with a focus on exports, allowing cash to flow into the country and further develop her industries. To this end, we intend to raise industrial tariffs while seeking free trade arrangements for our agricultural produce."
 GRE_auth_dems:0 "Néo Krátos"
 GRE_auth_dems_desc:0 "The authoritarian, but still republican, New State have taken the lion's share of the influence in the new parliament. Fiercely anti-union and protectionist, their rule promises to take a firm hand to radicals if nothing else."
 GRE_smash_unionism:0 "Smash Unionism"
 GRE_smash_unionism_desc:0 "Unionism is a dangerous element of our society, just look at how it brought low the mighty British Empire. For the good of the people, unions must be suppressed and their leaders rooted out."
 GRE_finding_our_own_way:0 "Finding our own Way"
 GRE_finding_our_own_way_desc:0 "Greece must find its own way towards greater industrialisation - somewhere between providing incentives for private corporations, but also not relinquishing the government's right to decide which industries are best to promote and which must remain under our direct control. We will see Greece forge a path to true economic strength... but we shall do it the Greek way."
 GRE_reverse_secularisation:0 "Reverse Secularisation"
 GRE_reverse_secularisation_desc:0 "Greece is, has always been, a Christian nation first and foremost. It was the Church that led us to independence and the attempts by the liberal parties to end the marriage of State and Faith must be reversed."
 GRE_sponsor_church_schools:0 "Sponsor Church Schools"
 GRE_sponsor_church_schools_desc:0 "Official state support given to faith schools of all education tiers, from primary schools all the way to church-run universities, will help to both promote scientific education and to solidify Christian values into our society."

 GRE_christian_democracy_desc:0 "We are fortunate that the will of our people is guided by Christian values and a desire to build a more virtuous society. Stability will come to Greece with the government pairing with the Church to give them a place in parliament where they belong."
 GRE_managed_democracy:0 "Managed Democracy"
 GRE_managed_democracy_desc:0 "Democracy is a proud Hellenic invention that we will continue to preserve. However its myriad dangers mean it must be carefully tended by a strong judiciary and executive, lest it be subverted from within."
 GRE_moral_greece:0 "A Moral Greece"
 GRE_moral_greece_desc:0 "Together in Greece we are building a better future, a more Christian, more moral future. Our economy must thrive but it must also put Christian values of justice, peace and humility first."

 GRE_radical_socialists:0 "Agrotikó Dimokratikó Métopos"

 GRE_abolish_landlordism:0 "Abolish Landlordism"
 GRE_abolish_landlordism_desc:0 "Landlords are one of the primary means via which the peasantry is oppressed in our country. By liquidating all those who do not work the land directly and distributing their land to agricultural communes we can ensure our farmers will no longer suffer under their heel."
 GRE_planned_industry:0 "Planned Industry"
 GRE_planned_industry_desc:0 "Unlike what many believe, agrarianism is not antithetical to a strong industrial state. Quite the opposite, in fact. Industrialisation, however, must be carefully planned so it does not disturb the careful balance required by our agricultural sector. This requires heavy government intervention and control: the right industry in the right place, manned by the right people."
 GRE_soc_dems:0 "Ethnikón Enotikón Kómma"
 GRE_soc_dems_desc:0 "The much more moderate agrarians have won. While they intend to primarily support the peasantry through social reforms and subsidies, they are not as dedicated to the abolition of urban society and the bourgeoisie as their counterparts."
 GRE_political_liberties:0 "Political Liberties"
 GRE_political_liberties_desc:0 "Within Greece there is a lack of simple political freedoms for many of the lower classes. By bringing forth a series of reforms dedicated to extending the freedom of speech, association, and expression we can help the people's voice to be heard in politics."
 GRE_new_enterprise:0 "A New Enterprise"
 GRE_new_enterprise_desc:0 "A socialist state cannot truly be successful without creating a partnership with its private entrepreneurs and corporations.

 GRE_industrial_socialism:0 "Industrial Socialism"
 GRE_industrial_socialism_desc:0 "We will be a socialist state with a strong preference for our agrarian roots, it's true, but we will do it while also increasing our industrial strength. A true industrial state has a partnership with its agrarian base - they need not be enemies."

 GRE_syndicalist_victory:0 "First Hellenic Congress"
 GRE_syndicalist_victory_desc:0 "The first order of business will be to hold a congress and organise the trade unions - and part of that will be deciding who will be the new chairman.

 GRE_cooperate_with_agrarians:0 "Cooperate with the Agrarians"
 GRE_cooperate_with_agrarians_desc:0 "The Agrarian Party has a very different vision of socialism to the more orthodox syndicalists, envisioning a more pre-industrial society rooted in agricultural communes.

 GRE_establish_communes:0 "Establish Communes"
 GRE_establish_communes_desc:0 "By abolishing the old systems of local governance and establishing local communes in their place we can bring syndicalism to the people of Greece, and pave the way for the first true Congress of the Trade Unions to be held in this island of freedom from capitalist oppression."
 GRE_crush_bourgeoisie:0 "Crush the Bourgeoisie"
 GRE_crush_bourgeoisie_desc:0 "The Bourgeoisie are the truest enemy of the people, they must be shown that we will not back down from our revolutionary aims.

 GRE_rally_behind_dioitikis_desc:0 "The Diokitis, a word which means 'leader' in the same sense as the Russian 'Vohzd', is the people's truest friend and guide through the long road to socialism.

 GRE_void_debts:0 "Void Debts"
 GRE_void_debts_desc:0 "Some nations have been clamouring for the new people's government to acknowledge and undertake payment of the old regime's debts. This is unacceptable - those debts belong to the capitalists and thieves who foisted them upon the people to begin with."
 GRE_leap_forward:0 "The Great Leap Forward"

 GRE_state_orthodoxy:0 "State Orthodoxy"
 GRE_state_orthodoxy_desc:0 "Orthodoxy is Greece's dominant religion, and will be a useful tool in informing people of the divinely appointed nature of their leadership. To that end, we must take steps to curtail the independence of the Greek Orthodox Church and bring it under state control."
 GRE_foreign_investment:0 "Lure Foreign Investment"

 GRE_propaganda:0 "The Art of Propaganda"
 GRE_propaganda_desc:0 "Everyone in Greece has opinions. It's what makes this country fine, but it is also what has driven us apart. The time has come to make sure that their opinions have something in common: that they all believe as we do, and that unity will make us stronger."

 GRE_evaluate_army:0 "Ellenicós Stratós"
 GRE_evaluate_army_desc:0 "Cut off from much of our manpower base thanks to the Weltkrieg we are divided between two schools of thought, one favours leveraging a material advantage over the enemy and devastating him with sheer firepower; the other meticulous planning in order to prevent losses by executing operations with the utmost efficiency."

 GRE_artillery_focus:0 "Increase Artillery Research"
 GRE_artillery_focus_desc:0 "As the British learned during the Weltkrieg, there may never be enough shells.

Now is the time to pursue a treaty of non-aggression and cooperation, and ideally work towards an exchange of population: let us bring Greeks living under the Turks back to our country, and send the Turks living here back to theirs.

 GRE_balkans_trade:0 "Balkans Cooperation"
 GRE_balkans_trade_desc:0 "We should expand our mutual cooperation with the Balkan neighbours to our north. It is a way to ensure we enjoy greater investment in Greece, but hopefully will also be a way to promote peace in a region that has traditionally seen nothing but warfare."

### Events
 gre.1.t:0 "The Fourth Hellenic Republic"
 gre.1.d:0 "The years since Greece's loss in the Weltkrieg have seen little but upheaval and hardship. The loss of Macedonia to the Treaty of Salonika and crippling war debts to Austria and Germany sent King Alexander fleeing into exile as the Third Republic was declared... only to result in years of failed governments and coups until Georgios Kondylis took control in 1926 and declared himself the permanent Regent of Greece, even though its king remained in exile. Kondylis was finally overthrown and executed in 1931, leading to the Fourth Republic and the coalition government of Geórgios Papandreou which won its first election."
 gre.1.a:0 "Goodness!"

 gre.2.t:0 "The Challenges Ahead"
 gre.2.d:0 "The new republic, which faces its next election in 1938, faces several challenges before then: most prominent is the simmering resentment towards the loss of Greek territory. Most are certain that war is coming again soon, with many groups such as the syndicalist rebels and the looming figure of Ioannis Metaxas waiting for the first moment the government makes the slightest misstep. Monarchist sentiment is also on the rise, with many demanding that another referendum be held soon to determine whether the kingdom should be restored... even if republicans fear that doing so would only plunge the nation into anarchy yet again."
 gre.2.a:0 "We shall not repeat past mistakes."

 gre.3.t:0 "Independence Day"
 gre.3.d:0 "In 1821, Greeks rose up against the oppressive Ottoman Empire, which had occupied Greece for nearly four hundred years. Bishop Germanos of Patras boldly raised the Greek flag at the monastery of Agia Lavras, inciting the Greek revolution. While the exact date probably was not March 25th, it did occur in late March and it was gradually associated with the religious feast of the Annunciation which occurs on the same date. On the day of the Feast of the Annunciation the archangel Gabriel appeared to the maiden Mary and announced the news, she was pregnant with the divine child. Bishop Germanos chose this day to deliver a different but not unrelated message, a new spirit was about to be born in Greece."
 gre.3.a:0 "A new spirit shall be born again!"
 gre.4.d:0 "Independence Day is celebrated once again in [Root.GetNameDef], with crowds lining the streets in Athens and other cities, all waving the Greek flag and singing 'Ýmnos is tin Eleftherían' - the Hymn to Freedom, and the country's national anthem. Despite all the hardship the country has faced, its people are still eager to celebrate their sense of independence from those who would oppress them."
 gre.4.a:0 "Hail, o hail, Liberty!"

 gre.5.t:0 "Black Monday hits Greece!"
 gre.5.d:0 "The rapid German economic collapse has reached our nation! Our reliance on trade with Germany and Mitteleuropean dominance of our economy has exacerbated the crisis, with many German factories being instructed to shut down. Worse, the spread of the crisis has meant a lack of markets for our agricultural exports, and already farmers are facing a crisis where almost none of them can sell their crops. We must quickly work to address this crisis, lest it grow out of hand and sow chaos throughout our nation."
 gre.5.a:0 "O Theós na mas voithísei!"

 gre.6.t:0 "Responding to the Crisis"
 gre.6.d:0 "With the number of farmers left holding crops and nowhere to sell them, we are left with a choice: either support them for the current year and encourage them to switch away from their reliance on exports, or dig deep into our pockets and support them fully until the economic crisis has passed."
 gre.6.a:0 "Help them out as much as we can."
 gre.6.b:0 "Dig deep - they're the backbone of Greece."

 gre.7.t:0 "Foreign-Owned Industry"
 gre.7.d:0 "Almost half of our economy is owned by investors in Germany and Austria, but after Black Monday many of their mines and factories have closed down - some because they have become unprofitable but others because the investors are trying to save money or have gone bankrupt. In either case, many thousands of Greeks have been put out of work. The suggestion is that we should seize these assets, or at least the worst cases, despite the Treaty of Salonika stipulating that we cannot. The only way to prevent a backlash from either country, however, is to subsidise the investors out of our own pocket... a deeply unpopular move if we attempted it, to be sure."
 gre.7.a:0 "Seize it all, no matter the repercussions."
 gre.7.b:0 "Deal with the worst cases only."
 gre.7.c:0 "Subsidise the investors ourselves - they'd better be grateful."

 gre.8.t:0 "Greece Seizes [Root.GetAdjective] Assets"
 gre.8.d:0 "Thanks to the rippling effects of Black Monday, [Root.GetAdjective] investors who held majority shares in Greek factories and mines have been closing those businesses down - in some cases because they're unprofitable, but in others because the investors have gone bankrupt. The Greek government has responded by seizing the companies, despite the Treaty of Salonika signed after the war stipulating that our investors have unfettered access to their economy. Many in the government are suggesting we respond harshly, and not only apply sanctions but pull all investment out of [From.GetNameDef] altogether.

The Greek government has responded by seizing many of the worst cases, despite the Treaty of Salonika signed after the war stipulating that our investors have unfettered access to their economy. Many in the government are suggesting we respond with sanctions, while others say the Greeks are simply doing what they have to in order to survive - they could, after all, have seized all investor assets if they'd wished, and not simply some."

In the end, the congress turned into a struggle between two men: the acting chairman, Nikos Zachariadis, and the charismatic general, Aris Velouchiotis.

While many consider the congress a sad farewell to their leader, the delegates now must choose his replacement: either the moderate Konstantinos Speras, running once again, or the new and charismatic upstart, Nikos Beloyannis."
 gre.157.d.notzach:0 "Syndicalists and trade union leaders from across the country met in Athens this week to vote on the chairmanship, with Konstantinos Speras challenged by young an charismatic upstart Nikos Beloyannis - who has already won over a large number of delegates despite his age."

 gre.200.d:0 "While our relations with the Greeks have been cool at best since their rebellion from Turkish rule in the 19th century, today we received several emissaries from [GRE.GetNameDef] who are hopeful to start a new era of peace between our nations - perhaps even going so far as to eventually work out an exchange of land and people, without the need to resort to further war. For today, however, they Greeks are looking for an indication that we might be open to such talks in the future."
 gre.200.a:0 "We welcome better relations with the Greeks."
 gre.200.b:0 "No, we've no need for this."

 gre.202.a:0 "So much for diplomacy."

 gre.203.t:0 "A Treaty with [GRE.GetNameDef]?"
 gre.203.d:0 "For several weeks now, [Root.GetAdjective] officials have been in talks with emissaries from [GRE.GetNameDef] about the possibility of a treaty of cooperation. This would mean an end to hostilities with the Greeks, and a sorting out of our differences. What the Greeks are asking for is this: we give them any states integral to their country, and they give us ours, while each of us give up any claims to other territories. We also begin an exchange of population, with Turks in [GRE.GetNameDef] coming to [Root.GetNameDef] but our much greater number of Greeks leaving for their country. In exchange, they will sign a pact of non-aggression, and we will do the same. The disruption caused by such a massive displacement of people will be considerable... but perhaps it might be worth it, in the end?"
 gre.203.a:0 "We agree to their terms."
 gre.203.b:0 "We agree to everything but surrendering land."
 gre.203.c:0 "No, they are asking for far too much."

 gre.204.t:0 "The Turks Refuse to Surrender Land"
 gre.204.d:0 "After weeks of discussion, the [From.GetAdjective] government has stated it would agree to an exchange of populations between our countries, and also make a pledge of non-aggression... but under no circumstances will they turn over land we believe is rightfully ours. Is it worth agreeing to the rest of the treaty, knowing that our mutual claims could very well lead us back to war in time anyway?"
 gre.204.a:0 "Then there's no deal."
 gre.204.b:0 "Very well, we'll work with that."

 gre.205.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused"
 gre.205.d:0 "We did our best to conclude the deal, but without agreeing to exchange the territories the Greeks see no point in pursuing a treaty of non-aggression."
 gre.205.a:0 "So be it!"

 gre.206.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Agreed"
 gre.206.d:0 "The Greeks have agreed to our modified deal. It may mean we'll end up back at each other's throats in time, but for now there will be peace... and once the disruption caused by the exchange of population is over, chances are [Root.GetNameDef] will experience far fewer internal problems caused by their presence."
 gre.206.a:0 "Excellent."

 gre.207.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 gre.207.d:0 "After weeks of negotiation, the [From.GetAdjective] government finally ended the talks with [Root.GetNameDef] and no treaty worked out. There were simply too many points of contention that [From.GetNameDef] was unwilling to budge on, and se we leave empty handed."
 gre.207.a:0 "It was worth the attempt."

 gre.208.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Agreed"
 gre.208.d:0 "After weeks of negotiation, we have come to an agreement with [From.GetNameDef] on a treaty between our nations. A pledge of non-aggression has already been signed, and within a month's time the exchange of populations will begin. This will mean a large number of people coming into [Root.GetNameDef]. We will need to be ready for a great deal of disruption."
 gre.208.a:0 "We will gladly welcome them home."

 gre.210.t:0 "The Exchange Begins"
 gre.210.d:0 "The population exchange between [Root.GetNameDef] and [GRE.GetNameDef] has begun, with thousands of Turks arriving daily... but many more Greeks leaving. The disruption is worse than we imagined, and there is a considerable amount of looting occurring in the homes left behind by the Greeks. Many of the refugees are reportedly starving or becoming ill en route, considering some have no means of transportation other than to walk to [GRE.GetNameDef] on foot or to take ramshackle boats across the Aegean. Authorities are already moving in to try and keep order where they can, and ideally this will sort itself out in time."
 gre.210.a:0 "It's for the best."

 gre.212.a:0 "That's finally over, then?"

 gre.213.t:0 "Mission from [GRE.GetNameDef]"
 gre.213.d:0 "The [GRE.GetAdjective] ambassador has been in talks with [Root.GetAdjective] officials over the past several weeks, attempting to foster better relations and more mutual cooperation between our nations. While some in the government are suspicious of their motives, it does appear as if their intentions are nothing more than to foster greater peace in the region."
 gre.213.a:0 "Yes, let's work more closely with the Greeks."
 gre.213.b:0 "No, there's no need for this."

 gre.214.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Agreed"
 gre.214.d:0 "After discussions between the [Root.GetAdjective] ambassador and the [From.GetAdjective] government, they have agreed to increase ties between our nations."
 gre.214.a:0 "Well done!"

 gre.215.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused"
 gre.215.d:0 "It appears that suspicions between the nations of the Balkans runs too deeply. The [From.GetAdjective] government listened to our ambassador and made non-committal noises of agreement... but nothing has come of it, and relations between our countries remains unchanged."
 gre.215.a:0 "Too bad."

 gre.216.t:0 "Greater Balkans Cooperation"
 gre.216.d:0 "Our efforts to foster better relations with other countries in the Balkans has paid off - namely with greater investment in [Root.GetNameDef] and greater confidence amongst our citizens that peace will be maintained."
 gre.216.a:0 "Good to hear."

 gre.250.t:0 "[GRE.GetNameDefCap] Resurrects Megali Idea"
 gre.250.d:0 "The Greeks have become increasingly revanchist over the last several months, making motions at resurrecting the 'Megali Idea' which aims at reclaiming ethnically Greek lands - though we note they have restrained themselves from claiming broader territories in Asia Minor, their claims more or less ending at Constantinople. We can warn them to abandon these claims entirely or go along with them, even though it likely means dragging the [Root.GetFactionName] into their war."
 gre.250.d.full:0 "The Greeks have become increasingly revanchist over the last several months, making motions at resurrecting the 'Megali Idea' which aims at reclaiming ethnically Greek lands - but goes far beyond their traditional territory, including [773.GetName] and the western coast of Anatolia, which are primarily Turkish. We can warn them to abandon these rash claims entirely or go along with them, even though it likely means dragging the [Root.GetFactionName] into their war."
 gre.250.a:0 "We support them, no matter what"
 gre.250.b:0 "This is unacceptable - they either desist or they go"

 gre.251.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Supports Us"
 gre.251.d:0 "While some were nervous that [From.GetNameDef] would refuse to be dragged into an irredentist war with us, that has not proven to be the case. The [From.GetAdjective] government has declared their support for us, and - as our ally - will be there for whatever war we decide to pursue."
 gre.251.a:0 "Excellent"

 gre.252.t:0 "A Warning from [From.GetNameDef]"
 gre.252.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has gotten wind of our intention to reclaim ethnically Greek lands in Anatolia, and informed us in no uncertain terms that, if we do not abandon all our claims immediately, we will pursue our wars outside of the [From.GetAdjective] alliance."
 gre.252.a:0 "Then Megali dies here"
 gre.252.b:0 "Then we are on our own"

 gre.253.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Leaves the [Root.GetFactionName]"
 gre.253.d.allies:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has decided to abandon the [Root.GetFactionName] and pursue its reckless claims on Greek territory... which includes our own allies. Whether this means war with [From.GetNameDef] remains to be seen."

 gre.253.a:0 "Good luck with that!"

 gre.254.t:0 "The Greeks Offer Peace"
 gre.254.d:0 "We are losing the war with the Greeks - badly. They have contacted the [Root.GetAdjective] government and offered peace, in exchange for all their claimed territories. It is a hard pill to swallow, but the alternative is very likely for us to be crushed completely."
 gre.254.a:0 "We must make peace while we can"

 gre.256.t:0 "A New Capital?"
 gre.256.d:0 "Konstantinoúpolis is once again under our control, and a question has now been risen: should the [Root.GetAdjective] capital be moved? For the sake of stability, some are saying it should not... but there are still others who say it is the greatest city in our nation, perhaps the greatest in our history. With the glory of [Root.GetNameDef] having been achieved, perhaps it should be reflected in our seat of government?"
 gre.256.a:0 "Yes, this is the proper capital of our nation."

Megali is an elusive but dangerous dream... if we pursue it, it will be seen as an aggressive move on our part, and we may be kicked out of the [Root.GetFactionName] as a result."
