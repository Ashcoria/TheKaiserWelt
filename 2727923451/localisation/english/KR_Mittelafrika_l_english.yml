### Leaders ###
 POLITICS_GOERING_DESC:0 "Von Göring came to prominence as one of Germany's more successful fighter pilots of the Weltkrieg, scoring more than twenty victories by the end of the war, which earned him numerous decorations.\n\nHis ambitions soon turned political with his becoming chair of the Alldeutsche Verband which he led to an 8% Electoral turnout in 1928. Following this, he was appointed to Mittelafrika by Wilhelm II himself who saw von Göring as a rising capable man. Von Göring sees this as a springboard and his ticket to claiming the chancellery after a successful term in the colonies."

 MAF_Cut_Supply:0 "Cut off funding"
 MAF_Cut_Supply_desc:0 "In order to stave off ideas like "sovereignty", the German homeland has decided to punish Mittelafrika with a reduction in its supplies and funding.\nWithout much of the vital supply required in order to maintain the pacification of untamed areas, many areas on the dark continent are slipping away from Dar-es-Salaam's control, and are at risk of slipping into the control of local forces.\nIt's to be seen if this move manages to affect the wayward colonial authorities to come begging back for the fatherland's help, or if it is merely just another step in the gradual loss of control that has been plaguing the administration."
 MAF_border_shit_show:0 "Border Raids"

 MAF_Lost_Bushwar_Debuff:0 "Rising Resistance"

With the colonial forces battered, and their reputation as an undefeated army tarnished, many are willing to take up arms and fight the German forces head-on, and colonial forces can't do much in the meantime to oppose them."
 MAF_Lost_Bushwar_Light_Debuff:0 "Recent Resistance"

With the colonial forces battered, and their reputation as an undefeated army somewhat tarnished, some are still willing to take up arms and fight the German forces head-on, and colonial forces are in weak shape to oppose them."
 MAF_post_collapse_army:0 "'Unconventional Army"
 MAF_post_collapse_army_desc:0 "Armies created following the collapse of Mittelafrika aren't conventional. They don't have the same ability to defend and hold the line as more standard divisions, but are better able to move and fight in the harsh conditions of Africa. Additionally, while conventional factories are few and far between there are ample opportunities to scavenge equipment, providing a steady if limited supply of arms."

The situation is far from ideal - we lack the industry, men, and guns to match our old glory. But worse are the locals... they are eyeing our weakness, and their loyalties are shifting. Foreign powers, ambitious warlords, and internal fighting are chipping away at the fragile, rotting infrastructure our predecessors have neglected. We have to move fast, or else Germany will be lost!"

### Focuses ###
 MAF_Big_Change:0 "Time for Change"
 MAF_Big_Change_desc:0 "It is time for a change; we can no longer sit on the fence. We must either centralise or decentralise our nation if we are to keep hold of Africa."
 MAF_New_Administration:0 "A New Administration"
 MAF_New_Administration_desc:0 "In order to further assert our control over Africa, it is necessary to take inventory of our administrators and staff, and coordinate a plan of action."
 MAF_Sovereign_State:0 "A Sovereign State"
 MAF_Sovereign_State_desc:0 "Now that von Göring's position as Sovereign Statthalter has been established, it is time to turn the rest of our administration toward furthering our autonomy and authority."
 MAF_Establish_Lion_Society:0 "Establish the Lion Society"
 MAF_Establish_Lion_Society_desc:0 "Africa has long been rumoured to harbour secret societies like the 'Leopard' and 'Crocodile' societies, who are supposedly responsible for many unsolved murders and criminal acts. We can borrow this air of mystique for our own growing body of assassins and illicit enterprises."
 MAF_End_Protectorates:0 "End the Protectorates"
 MAF_End_Protectorates_desc:0 "Mittelafrika has always been a patchwork of treaties established with various African kingdoms, which retained their autonomy and royalty in exchange for acceptance of German sovereignty. It is time to end this, and have one law and one sovereign entity in Mittelafrika."
 MAF_Annex_British_Colonies:0 "Annex The British Colonies"
 MAF_Annex_British_Colonies_desc:0 "In 1925 the Island of Britain fell to the plague of socialism. Our armies moved into British territory to prevent the revolution from reaching Africa, establishing a trusteeship over the British colonies until a 'responsible British government' could be restored. We shall end this farce, the colonies are ours by right of conquest."
 MAF_Vizekonig:0 "Assume the Title 'Vizekönig'"
 MAF_Vizekonig_desc:0 "The Statthalter is not merely a bureaucrat fulfilling a government role. We have already established that he is not accountable to Germany, and it is now important to establish that he is co-equal to the highest authority in Africa. The Kaiser has given the Vizekönig a sacred trust. In Africa, the Vizekönig's word is the same as the Kaiser's."
 MAF_Four_Year_Plan:0 "Four Year Plan"
 MAF_Four_Year_Plan_desc:0 "Trouble is brewing in Europe and Asia, the syndicalists grow bolder every day while our own military has become complacent. We must plan a timetable for our economy and military to ensure that we are ready to support the Fatherland in any way possible."
 MAF_Protect_Animals:0 "Protected Endangered Species"
 MAF_Protect_Animals_desc:0 "It's incredulous to think, but some of the most iconic species of Africa, particularly the lion, are in danger of being totally exterminated, as the wolf was from Europe. In 1870, the last Atlas Bear was shot by hunters. Our Statthalter has a particular interest in pushing laws that ensure this will not happen to our native species."
 MAF_Kulturkampf:0 "A Second Kulturkampf"
 MAF_Kulturkampf_desc:0 "In the 1870s, the German Parliament passed 22 laws to curb the power of the Catholic Church. By ruthlessly enforcing these laws, we can curb foreign elements, and also ensure the monopoly of our own secular and German education system."
 MAF_Proving_Grounds:0 "Swakopmund Proving Grounds"
 MAF_Proving_Grounds_desc:0 "To train our administrators and public servants we send them to the Namibian desert for a week of harsh training and research where they are forced to rely on their strength and wit to survive. While this does cause a few deaths a year it surely makes our administration among the best trained in the world. If they can't survive in the Namibian desert are they really fit to serve in our administration?"
 MAF_Army_Reforms:0 "Reform the Army"
 MAF_Army_Reforms_desc:0 "The African Askari in 1914 was up to the standard of the contemporary European soldier. Today, he is still up to the standard of 1914. He is not ready for the kind of mechanised, artillery intensive battles we saw in Europe by the end of the war. We must fix this."
 MAF_Long_Range_Airforce:0 "A Long-Range Air Force"
 MAF_Long_Range_Airforce_desc:0 "Africa is far from the major theatres of war. In order to engage our enemies, we must construct a fleet of long-range bombers capable of even transoceanic voyages. Even if we never use it, our ability to project air power across the Indian and Atlantic oceans will greatly improve our prestige."
 MAF_Heavy_Equipment:0 "Heavy Equipment"
 MAF_Heavy_Equipment_desc:0 "If our military is to match the standards of Germany, we shall need equipment: tanks, planes, artillery guns, these are the weapons of modern war!"
 MAF_Africa_Army:0 "The Africa Divisions"
 MAF_Africa_Army_desc:0 "Now that we have achieved parity in modern warfare, it is not enough for our Askari to serve as a colonial police force. Like the Gurkhas for the British, and Senegalese for the French, the best of the native populace will serve as shock troops for the German army."
 MAF_Strategic_Export:0 "Strategic Resources Export"
 MAF_Strategic_Export_desc:0 "In the event of war, Mittelafrika must serve to feed the great German war machine. Expanding our production of strategic resources will ensure we can outproduce our enemies and strengthen the Fatherland."
 MAF_African_Breadbasket:0 "The African Breadbasket"
 MAF_African_Breadbasket_desc:0 "Much of Africa has little in the way of agricultural development, but what we do have is invested in cash crops suitable only for the tropics. The last Weltkrieg showed that Germany is vulnerable to its lack of foodstuffs, and so by focusing on staples such as corn and rice, rather than tobacco and pepper, we can help ensure victory."
 MAF_African_War_Industries:0 "African War Industries"
 MAF_African_War_Industries_desc:0 "African labourers will work for far less than the average German, if we pay them at all. It makes sense therefore to encourage the development of simple manufacturing processes suitable to Africa instead."
 MAF_War_Economy:0 "A War Economy"
 MAF_War_Economy_desc:0 "War is inevitable, and time is precious. In the Weltkrieg, we gained a great advantage by mobilising faster than the British in Africa. We must be the first to mobilise in the next war as well."
 MAF_Port_Renovation:0 "Port Renovation"
 MAF_Port_Renovation_desc:0 "In order to be of use to our Fatherland, our naval facilities must be expanded to accommodate larger ships, even battleships and aircraft carriers."
 MAF_Acquire_New_Blueprints:0 "Acquire New Blueprints"
 MAF_Acquire_New_Blueprints_desc:0 "By purchasing vessels from German shipyards, and purchasing antiquated vessels from the Kaiserliche Marine, we can stimulate the German economy and strengthen our own naval industry at the same time."
 MAF_Our_Own_Dockyards:0 "Our Own Dockyards"
 MAF_Our_Own_Dockyards_desc:0 "With the proper investment, we can establish naval dockyards of our own, and contribute to any new naval arms race."
 MAF_Sailing_With_Marine:0 "Sailing With the Kaiserliche Marine"
 MAF_Sailing_With_Marine_desc:0 "Our vessels should not simply patrol local waters. We should send them sailing from Kiel to Tsingtau on exercises with the Kaiserliche Marine."
 MAF_Back_To_Basics:0 "Back to the Basics"
 MAF_Back_To_Basics_desc:0 "Our administration draws from over 50 years of experience on the Dark Continent. Undefeated against impossible odds in the Weltkrieg, we understand that Africa is very different from Europe, and are aware of our limitations. This is our strength, not our weakness!"
 MAF_Royal_Tours:0 "Royal Tours"
 MAF_Royal_Tours_desc:0 "In Africa, we mostly rule through local intermediaries, Kings and Chieftains whose rule we back with iron authority. We can use them to help modernise from the ground up, while also integrating them better into the empire by introducing them to the society of Kings, Dukes and other Royalty that makes up our larger empire."
 MAF_Honorary_Officers:0 "Honorary Officers"
 MAF_Honorary_Officers_desc:0 "The core of our authority are the Askari, who obey without question, and the local authorities who can effectively administrate our territories. We should blend the two by adopting Kings and Chieftains as honorary officers in our armed forces."
 MAF_African_Studies:0 "Promote African Studies in Germany"
 MAF_African_Studies_desc:0 "The official language of our administration is Swahili, but there are few opportunities to learn it elsewhere, not to mention the hundreds of other native languages used in Africa. To have a steady supply of competent administrators, we should encourage German universities to train specialists in African languages and cultures."
 MAF_Bezirk:0 "Bezirksleiterrecht"
 MAF_Bezirk_desc:0 "Much of the law that ordinary Africans operate and face trial under is not German law, but local tribal laws, arbitrated by tribal leaders and elders. Rather than trying to stamp it out and flood our limited number of acceptable judges, lawyers and jurors, Rudolf Asmis has proposed we have teams of legal experts consult with the locals to put into writing and modernise their local laws."
 MAF_Strategic_Reserve:0 "Strategic Resources Reserve"
 MAF_Strategic_Reserve_desc:0 "In the last war, cut off from Germany, we had to improvise our own supplies. We found ways to manufacture torpedoes, artillery shells, dyes, liquors and foodstuffs out of practically nothing. We should perpetuate this tradition, and find ways to improvise the manufacture of goods if we are cut off from the Fatherland again."
 MAF_Cash_Crops:0 "Cash Crops Exports"
 MAF_Cash_Crops_desc:0 "It is no secret that the quest for exotic goods has always been a driver of imperialism. Many tropical crops can grow in the Sub-Saharan environment such as coffee and cocoa. We should focus on these rather than staples, importing food from Ukraine or East Prussia to make up for any imbalances."
 MAF_East_Asian_Exports:0 "East Asian Exports"
 MAF_East_Asian_Exports_desc:0 "We are only a part of Germany's vast colonial empire. We should make sure our trade doesn't only go to the metropole, but takes advantage of opportunities in the Orient."
 MAF_Cottage_Industries:0 "Cottage Industries"
 MAF_Cottage_Industries_desc:0 "It's strange to think, but even in the 20th century a great deal of work can be done by distributing work to the vast numbers of skilled Africans throughout the continent, many of them traditionally trained blacksmiths, in order to increase our production."
 MAF_African_Army:0 "An African Army"
 MAF_African_Army_desc:0 "We should never forget that our Askari are trained to secure and defend Africa. To this end, we require light infantry capable of operating in the brush and jungle on low supply."
 MAF_Airforce_Infantry:0 "Establish the Air Mobile Infantry"
 MAF_Airforce_Infantry_desc:0 "Ludwig von Bockholt, one of the main members of the DKG administration, has always been a daring innovator in air combat. His newest innovation: aerial deployment and resupply of full divisions."
 MAF_Improve_Logistics:0 "Improve our Logistics"
 MAF_Improve_Logistics_desc:0 "During the Weltkrieg, we required over 200,000 porters to supply a force of only 18,000 soldiers. This drained our food supplies and reduced our mobility to the rate at which humans can carry artillery. We cannot allow this to happen again."
 MAF_Spirit_Vorbeck:0 "The Spirit of von Lettow-Vorbeck"
 MAF_Spirit_Vorbeck_desc:0 "The most important lesson of the Weltkrieg cannot be found in any technical manual. It is exemplified in the sheer determination of General von Lettow-Vorbeck to continue fighting no matter how dire the situation might have appeared. In 1916, the Entente declared the situation in Africa over. In 1919 we were still standing, and still fighting. We never gave up, and we never will!"
 MAF_Electronic_Project:0 "Electronic Intelligence Project"
 MAF_Electronic_Project_desc:0 "Mittelafrika is not suited for a large navy, our shores are too large to protect and our industry would be better spent on other things. One such other thing is an investment in electronics technology, which will give us the ability to project power from Africa and help our Fatherland through intelligence gathering."
 MAF_Konigsburg_Gunners:0 "The Königsberg Gunners"
 MAF_Konigsburg_Gunners_desc:0 "Aside from lake battles using improvised steamers, Africa saw little naval action during the Weltkrieg. Its largest battle was that of the Rufiji Delta, where the SMS Königsberg was severely damaged before being scuttled. Its crew, however, fought on overland, so it is no wonder that some of our naval officers, such as Richard Wenig, possess expertise in naval infantry tactics."
 MAF_Naval_Aerial_Observation:0 "Naval Aerial Observation"
 MAF_Naval_Aerial_Observation_desc:0 "To build on the strength of our geographic position, we should improve the observation and interdiction ability of naval aircraft. Conventional German naval aircraft are designed with the short ranges of the North Sea in mind, so we must develop facilities to modify planes for our needs."
 MAF_Our_Shipyards:0 "Our Own Shipyards"
 MAF_Our_Shipyards_desc:0 "Our current policy of adapting and refitting outdated ships from the Kaiserliche Marine is both costly and ineffective. The ships we receive are too slow for modern vessels and are in frequent need of costly repairs. Instead of large, rusting cruisers, we should be focusing on state-of-the-art destroyers and U-Boats to keep our operating costs low."
 MAF_African_Landtag:0 "An African Landtag"
 MAF_African_Landtag_desc:0 "Rather than all power residing in the Statthalter, we shall have two branches of legislature, a Herrenhaus made up of German noblemen and African kings, and an Abgeordnetenhaus, decided on by mainly white voters."
 MAF_Reform_Schutztruppe:0 "Reform the Schutztruppe"
 MAF_Reform_Schutztruppe_desc:0 "For too long our Schutztruppe has operated in military fashion despite not being part of the German military. Though they displayed outstanding bravery during the Weltkrieg, they are a police force, not an occupying army. It's time they acted like it."
 MAF_Autonomous_Kingdoms:0 "Autonomous Kingdoms"
 MAF_Autonomous_Kingdoms_desc:0 "Some areas of Africa are not suitable for white settlement, and our rule is particularly dependent on the goodwill of local rulers. Rather than trying to coordinate, we should grant them greater independence and autonomy, though naturally with ourselves as suzerain."
 MAF_Restore_British_Selfrule:0 "Restore British Self Rule"
 MAF_Restore_British_Selfrule_desc:0 "Integrating the British into our parliament is a nightmare. They do not have German citizenship, so they cannot vote, but the British have a deep love of parliamentarianism and shall resent their comparative privileges. We should instead restore some measure of self-rule to these people, as part of our trusteeship to restore responsible government to these territories."
 MAF_Hold_Elections:0 "Hold Elections"
 MAF_Hold_Elections_desc:0 "It is time to hold Mittelafrika's first-ever elections. They shall commence in about half a year, after all the parties have had time to campaign."
 MAF_Deal_With_Europeans:0 "Deal with the Europeans"
 MAF_Deal_With_Europeans_desc:0 "The Belgian and British citizens of our colony are very disproportionally influential, and it is time we deal with them one way or another."
 MAF_Block_FW_Investment:0 "Block Belgian Investment"
 MAF_Block_FW_Investment_desc:0 "For too long the Belgians have played a disproportionately large role in the economy of our colony. We should take measures to ensure only German companies have access to these opportunities."
 MAF_Seize_FW_Industries:0 "Seize Belgian Industries"
 MAF_Seize_FW_Industries_desc:0 "Now that we've broken the power of Belgian capital, their investors are eager to leave. We can seize upon any excuse we want to claim their industries as our own, or purchase them for a paltry sum."
 MAF_Expel_Alien_Nationals:0 "Expel Belgian Nationals"
 MAF_Expel_Alien_Nationals_desc:0 "Unlike the British, the Belgians rarely come here to settle. Most of them are technicians and skilled labourers who work here and then simply return to Europe to be later replaced by their fellow countrymen. Therefore, it is much easier to simply deport them back to Belgium."
 MAF_Attract_Belgian_Investment:0 "Attract Belgian Investment"
 MAF_Attract_Belgian_Investment_desc:0 "The Belgians have been here long before us as a colonial power, and they've never really left. We have a comfortable and working relationship with numerous mining firms that have actually expanded beyond their original holdings in the Congo. If we continue this policy, we can reap the benefits of their capital."
 MAF_Grant_Cons_FW:0 "Belgian Resource Companies"
 MAF_Grant_Cons_FW_desc:0 "By granting the Belgian conglomerates autonomy and security rights over remote stretches of the Congo, we can ensure a more disciplined workforce."
 MAF_Intergrate_FW:0 "Integrate Belgian Officers"
 MAF_Intergrate_FW_desc:0 "We fought against them in the Weltkrieg, but now the people of Belgium are our allies. Many of their officers have experience with commanding troops in Africa. We can use them."
 MAF_Deal_With_Belgians:0 "Deal with the Belgians"
 MAF_Deal_With_Belgians_desc:0 "Now that we have dealt with the Belgians and their ACC, it is time to make our arrangement with them permanent."
 MAF_Disarm_Anglos:0 "Disarm the Anglo Security Forces"
 MAF_Disarm_Anglos_desc:0 "Even before our arrival, the British populations of Kenya and Northern Rhodesia worked to ensure their security through 'rifle clubs', auxiliary police associations and paramilitaries. Participation rates have increased since our occupation, and so we must break up these groups if we are to truly rule the British territories."
 MAF_Remove_Brit_Service:0 "Remove the British from the Civil Service"
 MAF_Remove_Brit_Service_desc:0 "Positions in the former British colonies are often staffed by Swahili-speaking Britons. We should endeavour to drive them out and fully Germanise the administration."
 MAF_German_Education_Brits:0 "German Education for the Children"
 MAF_German_Education_Brits_desc:0 "Growing off the base of our colony in East Africa, the official language of our administration is Swahili, not German. This has allowed the British to maintain the use of their original languages by using Swahili only when dealing with our administration. By instituting mandatory German education, we can Germanise the British population."
 MAF_Support_Anglos:0 "Officially Support the Anglo Security Forces"
 MAF_Support_Anglos_desc:0 "While some may see the militarisation of the British settlers as a threat, we see it as an opportunity. A large armed, conservative and white population can reinforce our rule and protect against native uprisings. We should grant our official blessing to these organisations."
 MAF_Intergrate_Anglos:0 "Integrate the Anglo Security Forces"
 MAF_Intergrate_Anglos_desc:0 "We can reduce discontent in our British trusteeships by offering their officers commissions in our forces at an equivalent rank. They will feel less like a subject population, and we get a wealth of well-trained officers."
 MAF_Canadian_Volunteers:0 "British Volunteers"
 MAF_Canadian_Volunteers_desc:0 "While we have integrated the British into our forces, some more patriotic members are eager to retake their home island. Since we're co-belligerents against the socialists, we should encourage them, and allow the training of a few divisions for front line duty."

 MAF_Float_Mark:0 "Float the Mark"
 MAF_Float_Mark_desc:0 "Since 1921, our colony has printed its own currency, the Afrikan Mark, which has been pegged to the German Mark. By allowing our currency to float, we can reduce the price of our exports, and return revenue to normal."
 MAF_Fiscal_Austerity:0 "Fiscal Austerity"

 MAF_Cape_Cairo:0 "The Cape to Cairo Railway"
 MAF_Cape_Cairo_desc:0 "It is time to finish what the British started, the Cape to Cairo Railroad will lead to massive economic growth across the continent. First, we must build up the infrastructure around Tanganyika."

 MAF_Kampala_Khartoum:0 "Kampala to Khartoum"
 MAF_Kampala_Khartoum_desc:0 "The final step of the Cape to Cairo railroad lies in the Sudan; we must connect Kampala to Khartoum. While some of the work lies outside our borders, as long as we are willing to supply the manpower this wouldn't be an issue."
 MAF_Connect_Addis:0 "Khartoum to Addis Ababa"
 MAF_Connect_Addis_desc:0 "It is time to expand the Cape to Cairo railroad by connecting it to Ethiopia, opening up a new route for trade in Africa. Once more we must supply the manpower, but the economic benefits will surely outweigh any downsides."

 MAF_endurance_training:0 "Pilot Endurance Training"

The war in East Africa ended in a stalemate, where the Entente occupied German East Africa, while we occupied Mozambique. Both sides recruited thousands of Africans from 'enemy' territory as porters, armed guards or soldiers, and after the war, we had to punish those who joined the Entente's side. Now, many of those natives are displaced across the Mozambique border and there are many rumours that the new extremist government in Portugal is planning to arm them against us."

The war in East Africa ended in a stalemate, where the Entente occupied German East Africa, while the Germans occupied our Mozambique. Both sides recruited thousands of Africans from 'enemy' territory as porters, armed guards or soldiers, and after the war, the Huns led cruel reprisal attacks on the natives that joined our side. Since then, thousands of those natives have fled over the border into Mozambique where they now live in camps.

However, this does not mean that we cannot respond at all.

He is both an accomplished author, with his best-seller "Storm of Steel" and an educated entomologist, using his time in Africa to discover and document numerous species, while introducing our Askari to 'stormtrooper tactics'. Jünger broke with the German Army after a dispute carried through a series of articles published in military journals in the mid-20s.\n\nUnable to convince the General Staff to adopt his views, he took a transfer to Africa, where he was more free to implement his theories on the importance of psychology in modern warfare. A member of the Neue Kolonialregierung, Ernst Jünger will bring what he calls a "new spirit of adventure" to the colonisation of Africa, as well as help us reform our infantry tactics."

 mittel.57.d:0 "The Kaiser has appointed Franz Ritter von Epp as our Statthalter. A former General and current politician, Ritter von Epp fought in the Herero uprising and the ensuing repression, and earned the Pour le Mérite for his service in the Weltkrieg. After the war, Chancellor Ludendorf appointed him as the first postwar governor of Kamerun. Returning to Germany after serving as governor for three years, Ritter von Epp turned to politics, funding the creation of several patriotic newspapers, and serving in the Bavarian chamber of Imperial Counsellors. Ritter von Epp has never tried to hide his close ties to the Ludendorf dictatorship, and remains an outspoken apologist for Ludendorf. He is a controversial, almost belligerent figure, but the Kaiser has decided a fighting man is what Africa needs. A supporter of the Neue Kolonialregierung, Franz Ritter brings years of military experience and service to his post."

The owner of the United Steel Works, Thyssen is a towering figure in the world of German Commerce, having served as the head of the German Iron and Steel Industry Association and as a board member of the Reichsbank. He's also been active in politics, providing financial support to right-wing parties and newspapers. He breaks from the right however in his outspoken support for higher wages and benefits for workers. He believes, like Bismarck before him, that the threat of Socialism can be averted by assuring a decent standard of living for its workers. Thyssen claims it has the added benefit that well-paid workers can purchase more German-made products, stimulating the economy. Some are calling this model of paying workers high enough wages to purchase industrial output and ensure loyalty 'Thyssenism.' Fritz Thyssen has long been associated with the Neue Kolonialregierung, with rumours circulating that he helped fund Hermann von Göring's rise in politics, or that he was involved in the financial slush fund alleged in the 'Black Dossier'. None of these allegations have been proven yet, and the Kaiser has appointed Thyssen to the position of Statthalter, with a special eye to increase mining output in the Congo."

The young commander Bockholt flew the Airship L 59 "Afrika-Schiff" from Jamboli Airstation in Bulgaria to the Mahange plateau in Tanjanika, after a gruelling 100-hour flight across the deserts of Egypt and Sudan. The voyage resupplied our armies in Afrika with new weapons, ammunition, and most critically, quinine, that helped keep our armies in good fighting order until the Peace with Honour. It was the only resupply of East Afrika during the war, and holds other distinctions such as the longest military flight record, and flying the first aerial resupply mission. Because the mission was a one-way trip, Buckholt served the rest of the war as a naval infantry officer in the East Afrikan Theatre. After the war, Commodore Bockholt continued to refine his aerial resupply tactics and equipment, creating air mobile and later paratrooper naval infantry units. Despite such an innovative spirit, he is one of the leading officers of the Deutsche Kolonialgesellschaft, and proved to be a thorn in the side of Statthalter von Göring, clashing with him frequently on the direction, and command of Mittelafrika's Air Force. With Bockholt as our Statthalter, we can expect Mittelafrika to maintain world-class aerial infantry."

He took command of the battles of Kilimanjaro, Saliata Hill and Latema Nek, leading the troops to victory each time. After the war, he took divisional command and put down rebellions in the Upper Kongo and Ruvuma Valley. In 1925, he would be the one to negotiate the entry of German troops into British East Africa and conduct the occupation. Later, he would become commander of all armed forces in Mittelafrika. To the extent that the Deutsche Kolonialgesellschaft has a leader, it's him. With Generaloberst Georg Kraut in command, we can expect to continue the finest German military traditions."

He has served as a district officer in Togoland, Consul to the Belgian Congo, Counsellor to the General Government of Belgium, delegate to the Shanghai Convention, and most recently, head of the Reichskolonialamt. His most notable, and controversial work has been with his policy of 'Bezirksleiterrecht,' a policy of legitimising and formalising local and tribal law, and giving district officers the power to defer to this law in place of German Law. This has had been tried in Samoa with some success in reducing conflict with the locals. With such a long history in Imperial and Foreign affairs, he naturally has a close relationship with the Deutsche Kolonialgesellschaft, and will favour their ideas in decision making. A gifted diplomat with global experience as the head of the Reichskolonialamt, Dr Asmis is eager to see Afrika fulfil a key role in Germany's Weltpolitik."

Theodor von Hassel came to Afrika as a Oberleutnant in the Schutztruppe, and served in the Maji Maji rebellion. In the Siege of the Mahenge, his group of sixty soldiers held off several thousand rebel attackers, winning him the Order of the Red Eagle. After the Maji Maji war, von Hassel left the Schutztruppe to found a coffee farm, but volunteered for service during the Weltkrieg. After the war, he returned to his coffee plantation, which has grown into one of the most successful in Tanganyika. Dissatisfied with the way settlers like him were treated, and helped into politics by his father in law, the politician Jacob Jebsen, Theodor von Hassel spent years agitating on behalf of settlers' rights to democratic representation, as well as economic and political rights.

He is well respected for this reason and likely gave his blessing to the project. He is already quite old, and perhaps it will be easier and less suspicious to induce his retirement than to kill him.

 mittel.72.d:0 "We have long known that the officer clique behind the 'black dossier' must have been someone in the highest reaches of our administration. The source of the leak is even more embarrassing than expected. Von Göring's own brother, Albert, is the source. He has been staying in Africa under the fake name 'Albert von Epstein' a name based on the Göring family's Jewish doctor and godfather.

 mittel.111.t:0 "New Political Parties"
 mittel.111.d:0 "Now that our country has elections, it is no longer fitting that our politics are made up of military factions. The people who once supported the DKG have formed the Kaiser- und Vaterlandspartei, while those who once supported the NKR now support the Afrikanische Aktionspartei. A Social Democratic party has also been formed."

 mittel.112.d:0 "Now that their reforms have been implemented, the Reformgruppe has been struggling to come up with what to do next and this has caused a split in the party! The right wing of the party, which want to limit voting rights to whites and implement reforms to make white rule easier, have formed the Weißafrika-Partei, while the liberal wing of the party, which want to implement more liberal reforms, have formed the Neue Reformgruppe."

 mittel.114.d:0 "One of the Afrikanische Aktionspartei's main election promises was ending this farce called 'Mittelafrikan democracy' and restoring the Statthalter's ability to deliver fast action without worrying about what his white subjects think. To do so, we must abolish the shortlived Landtag and restore direct control of affairs to the Statthalter."
 mittel.114.a:0 "Statthalter Schmitt is wise."

 mittel.115.d:0 "The Kaiser has decided to appoint his own loyal man instead of listening to the will of the Mittelafrikan people...

 mittel.125.t:0 "The Kenyan Church"
 mittel.125.d:0 "When we moved into British Territory in 1925, the British hold on the territory was dangerously weak after 7 years of warfare. In the same year, British strikes coincided with a series of protests by the natives in British East Africa; the Church of Scotland Mission declared the practice of female circumcision banned for Christians, labelling it 'sexual mutilation of women'. For the dominant ethnic group of the region, the Kikuyu, the practice, which they call irua, is the 'conditio sine qua non' of the whole teaching of tribal law, religion. They felt so strongly about this that it has caused a rupture within the Christian community in Kikuyuland. The Anglican Church quickly followed the Scottish Church in banning the practice, but in response, the Kikuyu have created their own 'African Churches'. They've established their own theological schools, which have become a hotbed of Kikuyu nationalism. At the same time, with the fall of Britain to socialism, there is a schism within the Anglican and Scottish churches themselves. In Canterbury Cathedral, the Union of Britain has declared Archbishop John Hobbis Harris as the head of worldwide Anglican communion, while in Ottawa the British Monarch has declared, under his authority as Supreme Governor of the Church of England, Archbishop Cosmo Gordon Lang to be the head of the communion. The Scottish Kirk has seen a similar schism. It is impossible to tell for certain who any given Anglican minister believes is the real head of the church, and they might be listening to Archbishop Harris, who is a campaigner against imperialism in Africa."

Stumpf was an outspoken opponent of the Kikuyu practice of irua, and her body was discovered to have been cut in the traditional Kikuyu manner before she was murdered. Naturally, we suspect Kikuyu religious extremists."
 mittel.126.a:0 "Barbaric."

 mittel.127.t:0 "The Kenyan Highlands Settlement Policy"
 mittel.127.d:0 "The Highlands of Kenya are one of the few areas of Africa suitable to white settlement. The rare combination of cool uplands combined with healthy soil creates a climate almost like that of Europe, and excellent for farming. It is no wonder that the land there is in high demand.\n\nUnfortunately, it's long been economically underused. The British settlers have proven more interested in establishing themselves as landholders and letting the native Kikuyu do the labour. If we opened the land up to small German farmers squeezed by the Junker estates, we could improve productivity and increase our influence on the region, but it would also make the land shortage even more intense."
 mittel.127.a:0 "Allow for German settlement."

 mittel.128.t:0 "Land Crisis in the Kenyan Highlands"
 mittel.128.d:0 "Allowing German settlement in the Highlands of Kenia has only exacerbated the problems in the region, as it has set off land speculation, with prices rising out of control, and conflicts and disputes breaking out over the demarcation of a few metres of land. To make matters worse, for the local Kikuyu tribes, a man is not considered an adult until he owns at least some land. There are tribal territories set aside for this, but they are massively overcrowded, with most of them owning no land and working on British plantations. Additionally, an increasing amount of land within the tribal areas is monopolised by the local chiefs. This land shortage is creating unrest on all sides."

 mittel.129.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events, unknown gunmen shot and killed Senior Chief Waruhiu wa Kung'u this afternoon in broad daylight. Waruhiu was our senior collaborative official among the Kikuyu. Our security officials have been noting the rise of religious, oath based violence among the Kikuyu. Supposedly, they conduct 'magic rituals' under the cover of darkness, and swear oaths to kill white settlers. By killing Senior Chief Waruhiu, who had a bodyguard and was held in high esteem by our administration, they've demonstrated there's almost no one in the Kenyan Highlands they couldn't kill, right now."
 mittel.129.a:0 "Declare a state of emergency in Kenya."

 mittel.130.t:0 "Land Reclamation Completed"

The speech ended with an official proclamation: All treaties, titles, and privileges held by the African kingdoms and their subjects are now "unconditionally forfeit", with all former holders of titles expected to swear an oath of loyalty within the week. This marks a sharp turn in Mittelafrikan colonial policy, and is sure to have serious implications. We've stopped receiving communications from most of the continent, presumably as they protest..."

### DKAEB Events ###
 mittel.189.t:0 "The DKAEB Railroad Nears Bankruptcy"
 mittel.189.d:0 "The Deutsche Kaiserliche Abessinien Eisenbahn (DKAEB) railway was established in the early 20th century, linking Addis Ababa, in Ethiopia, to Djibouti. After a series of German-backed expansions, it is now used mainly to transport ore from the Congo Basin, in Mittelafrika, to Djibouti. The present economic downturn in the world has meant that ore is no longer being purchased at the rate it once was, resulting in fewer transports for the DKAEB. The DKAEB is struggling financially, and some board members have approached the government in Dar-es-Salaam to sell their shares to our colony. Should we accept?"

The present economic downturn in the world has meant that ore is no longer being purchased at the rate it once was, resulting in fewer transports for the DKAEB. In order to prevent the Ethiopian state from obtaining control of the DKAEB, and losing a valuable trade link, the Mittelafrikan state has bought many shares in the railroad, to provide some state backing for the beleaguered company. However, allowing Mittelafrika to act unilaterally so soon after the Kenyatta-Solf case could embolden the politically dangerous Goering."

 mittel.191.d:0 "The Colonial Office in Berlin has issued a formal complaint against Statthalter Goering for his unilateral purchase of the DKAEB shares. They clearly fear his political ambitions and are acting short-sightedly and against true German interest. The Office demands that we sell the shares to the Ethiopian state.

The present economic downturn in the world has meant that ore is no longer being purchased at the rate it once was, resulting in fewer transports for the DKAEB. In order to prevent Ethiopia from slipping from our grip, Dar-es-Salaam has requested they be allowed to take action.

They have kicked the problem back to us, telling us they trust Statthalter Goering's judgement in this matter. If we were to keep the railroad, we would likely have to spend time keeping it afloat that we could otherwise spend on halting the effects of Black Monday, but if we did nothing we would lose the Ethiopians as a possible ally."

We have mismanaged the project to save it, although the Ethiopians appear to have cooperated, and we now have no choice to sell our shares to the Ethiopian government. Statthalter Goering's reputation has suffered accordingly - it seems increasingly unlikely he will be able to make Mittelafrika profitable without resorting to drastic measures."

It seems the Ethiopians and Mittelafrikan government have cooperated to keep the trading link open. Our relationship with Ethiopia seems to be secure, and might deepen to alliance eventually."

The city is still in shock and the perpetrator, along with his supporters, have been detained for investigation by the local police. It appears we are already managing to destabilise the Mittelafrikan government. It should be noted that he used a weapon supplied by us, but we are confident it won't get traced back to us."
