### Leaders ###
 POLITICS_SEBASTIEN_FAURE_DESC:0 "Sébastien Faure is the first Anarchiste to serve as Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Originally empowered to chairman in a compromise between the Travailleurs and Anarchistes, factionalism has grown considerably during his time in office, and the apparatus of the state has weakened. If any faction manages to gain a clear majority in the Comité de Salut Public and the Bourse Générale du Travail, Faure is likely to be ousted."
 POLITICS_LEON_JOUHAUX_DESC:0 "Léon Jouhaux has been elected Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Jouhaux, as a revolutionary trade unionist, participated in the general strike of 1919 which precipitated the Commune's establishment. He is an adherent of orthodox French syndicalism, a true centrist among the factions of the Commune."
 POLITICS_BENOIT_FRACHON_DESC:0 "Benoît Frachon, a veteran of the French Civil War, has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. While a Syndicalist, he is sympathetic towards the opposing anarchiste faction; to that end, he has declared mending the Commune's factionalism the chief goal of his chairmanship."
 POLITICS_GAMELIN_DESC:0 "General Maurice Gamelin has overthrown the Jacobin regime of Marcel Déat. While his coup is an obvious affront to the already dubious Communard democratic process, many now regard Gamelin as the saviour of the Commune, and even syndicalism itself."
 POLITICS_MARCEL_CACHIN_DESC:0 "Marcel Cachin, former diplomat and bureau chief of the state-owned newspaper, Humanité, has become chairman of the Commune of France. While a Leninist, his diplomatic attitude and general charisma, allow him to retain some degree cordiality with syndicalists and anarchists."
 POLITICS_GEORGES_VALOIS_DESC:0 "Georges Valois, an adherent to the national-syndicalist teachings of Georges Sorel, has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Valois advocates the unification of the chairmanships of the Bourse Générale du Travail and Comité de Salut Public, a precursor in the eyes of many Communards, to tyranny."
 POLITICS_NESTOR_MAKHNO_DESC:0 "Nestor Makhno, Ukrainian anarchist, fled his homeland for France following German intervention in the Russian Civil War. Now, his firebrand denouncement of any and all state-authority has secured his French electoral victory. His radical vision of a nation, and perhaps world, without government of any kind, will likely not come to fruition in the foreseeable future, but his support for decentralisation could forever transform the Commune."
 POLITICS_JACQUES_DORIOT_DESC:0 "Jacques Doriot, veteran of the Weltkrieg, returned from captivity in Germany to find a France forever changed. His personal transformation from moderate socialist, to Leninist, and now national-syndicalist, has instilled in him an engrained proclivity for compromise."
 POLITICS_VINCENT_AURIOL_DESC:0 "Vincent Auriol, long accused by hardline syndicalists of harbouring sympathies for the bourgeoisie, has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. He advocates the gradual transition to a more democratic system of government in the Commune."
 POLITICS_DANIEL_GUERIN_DESC:0 "Daniel Guérin has now not only usurped from the charismatic Nestor Makhno leadership of the Anarchiste faction of the French Commune, but also won the chairmanship itself. Guérin is an academic, and a moderate in comparison to Makhno, who has proven to be a capable lawmaker."
 POLITICS_MARCEL_DEAT_DESC:0 "Marcel Déat has upended the Communard political system. A Leninist who has frequently made public his contempt for syndicalism, Déat stands in opposition to much of France's political establishment. His many enemies both within and outside France could lead to his, and perhaps also the Commune's, downfall."

He would graduate from the École Navale in 1902, and during the Weltkrieg would notably serve in an artillery battery at the Battle of Verdun. Swept in the chaos of the Revolution and spurned by his patriotism and moderate left-wing convictions, Darlan would rejoin the Communard Navy and over the next several years would rise rapidly through the ranks. He is now one of the most respected men in the French Navy, proud of the institution he has helped to rebuild."

### Ideas ###
 FRA_communard_spirit:0 "Communard Spirit"
 FRA_communard_spirit_desc:0 "We are the legacy of the Paris Commune, the first socialist state ever created and then brutally repressed by the Republican reactionaries. In 1920, the workers finally got their revenge and overthrew the military junta of the 'Party of Order'. We, sons and daughters of Communards must protect our state and our spirit, we will not be commanded by tyrants anymore!"

 FRA_to_war_idea:0 "Revanchist Rearmament"
 FRA_to_war_idea_desc:0 "Our nation must rise again if we are to defeat the Imperialists!"

 FRA_renseignements_generaux_lar:0 "Renseignements Généraux"

 FRA_economic_reforms_anar:0 "Economic Reforms"
 FRA_economic_reforms_anar_desc:0 "Wide-reaching economic reforms have been decided at the 1936 meeting of the Bourse Générale du Travail. These reforms have had noticeable effects on our economy already, helping making it more dynamic and solidifying it."

 FRA_economic_reforms_jaco:0 "Economic Reforms"
 FRA_economic_reforms_jaco_desc:0 "Wide-reaching economic reforms have been decided at the 1936 meeting of the Bourse Générale du Travail. These reforms have had noticeable effects on our economy already, helping making it more dynamic and solidifying it."

 FRA_economic_reforms:0 "Economic Reforms"
 FRA_economic_reforms_desc:0 "Wide-reaching economic reforms have been decided at the 1936 meeting of the Bourse Générale du Travail. These reforms have had noticeable effects on our economy already, helping making it more dynamic and solidifying it."

 FRA_military_buildup_two_idea:0 "Calibrated Economy"
 FRA_military_buildup_two_idea_desc:0 "As the world slowly approaches war again, we can rapidly capitalise on our healthy economy to rapidly switch parts of our economy to focus on military build-up. More factories are dedicated on arming our soldiers and building military structures, without any severe impact on our population."

 FRA_ruralism_idea:0 "Ruralism"
 FRA_ruralism_idea_desc:0 "The wide-reaching reforms to our industry and economy means than we no longer have massive industrial centres surrounding populous cities. This incidentally makes any attempt by enemy forces to cripple or even destroy our economy that much harder, with the biggest rural industrial centres far smaller and far more numerous than the great industry centres of Europe."

 FRA_market_socialism_idea:0 "Market Socialism"
 FRA_market_socialism_idea_desc:0 "Market Socialism is far more than a socialist interpretation of a market economy. By putting all the new worker cooperatives in a fair and equal competitive economy, we can make our civilian economy more dynamic and more efficient without having to directly intervene or go through slow, bloated unions in most cases."

 FRA_mass_production_idea:0 "Mass Production"
 FRA_mass_production_idea_desc:0 "Factories have always had a serious advantage over the artisan. By chaining production tasks, they can produce in a small frame of time infinitely more product without nearly equal quality. Instead of trying to constantly reinvent that process, let's improve on it. We seek absolute efficiency in production to beat the German capitalists."

 FRA_modern_farms_idea:0 "Modern Farms"
 FRA_modern_farms_idea_desc:0 "Farms are often seen as an old, quaint detail of the national economy, but we know better. By modernising and mechanising the Commune's farmlands, we can massively increase our agricultural output and both speed up and optimise harvest, production, refining and delivery. To our civilians, and to our troops."

 FRA_war_eco_agri_idea:0 "War, Economy and Agriculture"
 FRA_war_eco_agri_idea_desc:0 "Pioneered by Sorelian economy minister Jacques Doriot, the concept of War, Economy and Agriculture is an interesting one. Claiming that a war with Germany is not only inevitable but fast approaching, the Sorelians demand a rapid conversion to an economy whose industry can not only sustain a war, but whose agriculture can sustain its soldiers. In sum, a sort of total war economy."

 FRA_inter_coop_idea:0 "International Cooperation"
 FRA_inter_coop_idea_desc:0 "There is no shame in seeing what other countries are doing, and borrowing their new economic and industrial ideas to improve our own. Obviously, there are very few ideas we can seriously borrow from capitalist and reactionary societies, but our fellow Syndicalist brothers are fine examples at times."

 FRA_dedication_idea:0 "Sense of Dedication"
 FRA_dedication_idea_desc:0 "French workers work for more than their pay, and they certainly do not work at gunpoint. Every can they seal, every brick they lay, every rifle they assemble, every tank they weld together, is a service to their country and the spirit of the Commune at large."

 FRA_industralization_idea:0 "Communal Industrialisation"
 FRA_industralization_idea_desc:0 "Pioneered by Jacobin economy minister Ambroise Croizat, Industrialisation is no strange concept to anyone in the Commune or abroad. This policy aims to rapidly increase the industrial capacity of France in order to catch up to our arch nemesis Germany. This is accompanied by a work culture and the creation of dedicated factory towns."

 FRA_mass_fire_support_idea:0 "Mass Fire Support"
 FRA_mass_fire_support_idea_desc:0 "Every man has his rifle and grenade, every squad has its machine gun. By organising our divisions to provide fire to each other, we can another a new layer of fire support. Every time a division advances, all the other divisions suppress the enemy. By doing this in waves, we can rapidly gain ground. Now to supply the equipment needed."

 FRA_mass_conscription_idea:0 "Mass Mobilisation"
 FRA_mass_conscription_idea_desc:0 "Whereas our enemies have trouble enlisting enough soldiers to fight their reactionary and imperialist wars, every man is ready to fight for the Commune. Let us mobilise as many as our economy can sustain, we will overwhelm the reactionaries with our ultimate dedication to the Commune."

 FRA_empower_rifleman_idea:0 "Empower the Rifleman"
 FRA_empower_rifleman_idea_desc:0 "The Rifleman is more than a soldier with a gun. For too long he has been seen as incapable of any higher thinking other than firing his rifle by monarchist officers, seeing the working man with disdain. We will not make this mistake, the Rifleman should decide local tactics, increasing his efficiency on the battlefield."

 FRA_military_academy_idea:0 "Military Academy"
 FRA_military_academy_idea_desc:0 "We have to face the harsh reality that the Weltkrieg led to the downfall of most of our prestigious, if reactionary, military academies. While some claim this to be an acceptable status quo, we know better. Let us invest in new military academies to train skilled officers, for the future of the Communal Army."

 FRA_centralized_hc_idea:0 "Centralised High Command"
 FRA_centralized_hc_idea_desc:0 "The new Communal Army was not built like the old French army, many Communards resenting the military administration that tried to stifle the Commune, but we cannot leave our Officer Corps shattered. Let us centralise our High Command again, to better organise things some people like to forget, like logistics."

 FRA_tank_quality_line_idea:0 "Quality Tank Production"
 FRA_tank_quality_line_idea_desc:0 "What good is a tank if it doesn't perform as well as enemy tanks? We should not sacrifice on quality in favour of quantity, all this will lead to is more burning husks on the battlefield. Quality tanks, even if fewer in numbers, will take many times their numbers, making them a safe return on investment."

 FRA_tank_assembly_line_idea:0 "Tank Assembly Line"
 FRA_tank_assembly_line_idea_desc:0 "What good is a tank if the enemies have many more to throw against us? We cannot let perfectionists sabotage our assembly lines for minimal gains, or else we will be outnumbered. Quantity will allow us to overwhelm our enemies with entire divisions of cold hard steel, and many more shells flying at them."

 FRA_fast_army_idea:0 "Speed Cult"
 FRA_fast_army_idea_desc:0 "Speed is more than a small advantage or a way to get to the next point faster. Speed is integral to warfare. Those who think that the next Weltkrieg will be fought in trenches are deluded at best, mobile warfare is the way of the future. We must capitalise on fast, motorised divisions, if not a motorised army."

 FRA_Red_Army:0 "Grande Armée Rouge"
 FRA_Red_Army_desc:0 "Our army is in better shape than ever to face the evils of this capitalist world."

 Capital_Ship_Primacy:0 "Capital Ship Primacy"
 Capital_Ship_Primacy_desc:0 "A grand navy will be crucial to defeat the Kaiserliche Marine and bring the pain to Germany's northern coast. And in that role, the grand Battleship still shines. Its naval artillery will flatten the reactionaries with rolling barrages of thunder and steel, and send their boats to the bottom of the sea."

 Carrier_Primacy:0 "Carrier Primacy"
 Carrier_Primacy_desc:0 "The future of naval warfare is not in big, clunky warships, but in a combined arms approach with another front of future warfare, air warfare. Let us ensure that every naval group has a Carrier. Its fighters will ensure global air dominance, its naval bombers will wreck enemy ships and harbours alike."

 FRA_working_women_idea:0 "Working Women"
 FRA_working_women_idea_desc:0 "For too long have women been suppressed by reactionary thinkers. Even under the French Republic, they selflessly supported the nation while our brothers were sent to the slaughter. It is time for us to recognise their contribution to society, and formalise the rights of the working woman, in peace and war."

 FRA_bhartiya_support:0 "French Military Support"
 FRA_bhartiya_support_desc:0 "We are receiving military support from our French allies. This selfless assistance will prove critical to defeating the reactionary Princely Federation and the imperialist Dominion of India. In time, we hope to repay France for their help, but for now we must focus on the task at hand."

 FRA_amenagement_idea:0 "Aménagement of the Territory"
 FRA_amenagement_idea_desc:0 "France has historically been a very centralised country, meaning that most of the development has been limited to industrial cities and population centres. We have funded large projects to ensure that all parts of our territory are developed to a satisfactory manner."

 FRA_plan_prost_idea:0 "Plan Prost"
 FRA_plan_prost_idea_desc:0 "Henri Prost's plans for highways linking the Paris suburbs has proved to be popular across the country. Many other municipalities like Lyon or Marseille have also signed up to the plan, and projects are already being drawn for a large highway network linking all of France's major cities together, from Lille to Toulouse."

 FRA_paramilitary_gendarmes:0 "Paramilitary Gendarmes"
 FRA_paramilitary_gendarmes_desc:0 "The Gendarmes are a fine organisation, a paramilitary police force capable of both civilian and military activities. While many have pushed to completely disband them, we will instead expand their activities to make them a parallel force to the French Communal Police."

 FRA_secret_police:0 "Secret Police"
 FRA_secret_police_desc:0 "There are still many enemies of the Commune inside the Commune, sometimes even inside positions of power or within the military. This push for transparency is dangerous, we must instead organise secret police operations to ensure the safety of the French people from internal influences."

 FRA_demo_surete:0 "Sûreté Populaire Démocratique"
 FRA_demo_surete_desc:0 "We cannot allow paranoia to lead to the destruction of the fine balance we achieved with the Sûreté Populaire. By democratising the organisation, we will ensure that the French respect the Police not by fear but by an understanding of their actions and goals, and by knowing that they serve them first and foremost."

 FRA_hawkish_renseignements:0 "Revolutionary Renseignements"
 FRA_hawkish_renseignements_desc:0 "The Renseignements Généraux must ensure our safety from reactionary enemies abroad. Simple counter-espionage is not adequate, we must be ready to spy on enemy countries and support Syndicalist movements across the world. A good offence is the best defence."

 FRA_peace_renseignements:0 "Protective Renseignements"
 FRA_peace_renseignements_desc:0 "The Renseignements Généraux must ensure the safety of our country above all else. Counter-espionage is the centrepiece of an effective national defence, and there are many enemies that wait for a moment of weakness to influence and rile up our population."

 FRA_peaceful_revolution_idea:0 "Peaceful Revolution"
 FRA_peaceful_revolution_idea_desc:0 "The International Syndicalist Revolution will come, but it will be civilised. With the main reactionary powers in Europe finally shattered and their workers liberated, we aim to encourage further uprisings by merely proving the superiority of Syndicalism to the whole world."

 FRA_amateur_pilots_idea:0 "Amateur Pilots"
 FRA_amateur_pilots_idea_desc:0 "There are many in our country that have taken up flying as a hobby or a vocation, but not all of them pursue careers in the Air Force. They should preferably be drafted to our air force, where their skills will increase our chances of finding the new Aces of the Air."

 FRA_ecole_air_idea:0 "École de l'Air"
 FRA_ecole_air_idea_desc:0 "Flying is a skill by itself, and flying well in combat conditions is something that you can't just learn overnight. We won't repeat the mistakes of the Weltkrieg and its butcher of novice pilots, we need a large roster of well trained air pilots, and competent officers to lead them."

 FRA_waves_of_syndicalism_idea:0 "Waves of Syndicalism"
 FRA_waves_of_syndicalism_idea_desc:0 "The Commune's navy is mighty, and its reach is as far as we desire it to be. While we might lack the plentiful, worldwide ports of the French Empire of old, we still aim to have a navy that can intervene to any corner of the world at any time."

 FRA_cut_off_capitalists_idea:0 "Cut off the Capitalists"
 FRA_cut_off_capitalists_idea_desc:0 "The capitalists still pride themselves of their colonial territories. The fruit of their plunders still flow freely across the high seas. But if we have a say about it, we will ensure the stolen properties of the African, Asian and American workers will not enrich them."

 French_Revanchism_idea:0 "French Revanchism"
 French_Revanchism_idea_desc:0 "We have long prepared ourselves for this inevitable war. We have long cast away Pétain and his creed, but this does not mean we will forget what our brothers died for in the Ardennes, in Verdun, in the Chemin des Dames. We will avenge them, and once and for all regain what we deserved for our struggle."

 Revolutionary_spirit:0 "Revolutionary Spirit"
 Revolutionary_spirit_desc:0 "The survival and prosperity of the Syndicalist world will only be ensured when the last reactionary bastion is terminated. We must stand ready to mobilise and shatter every reactionary government across the world. One day, the Internationale will extend across all seas and continents!"

 FRA_socialist_education_idea:0 "Socialist Education"
 FRA_socialist_education_idea_desc:0 "The education of the youth is one of the greatest goals that a country like the Commune may face. Luckily, the old education system of the Republic was already revolutionary for its day, giving us a good basis for the new one. A socialist education system, focused on the sciences and arts."

 FRA_phalanstere_NOR:0 "Aid to Norway"
 FRA_phalanstere_NOR_desc:0 "We are currently providing industrial aid to our Norwegian brothers."

 COF_prodcsaplanes:0 "Producing Aircraft for the CSA"

 FRA_avantgarde_idea:0 "International Avant-Garde"
 FRA_avantgarde_idea_desc:0 "A united socialist artstyle, from art to music, could be a powerful tool that will help masses in the non-syndicalist world get interested in our ideals - through entertainment."

 FRA_amenagement:0 "Aménagement du Territoire"
 FRA_amenagement_desc:0 "Our territory is vast and inequally developed, some rural regions having been left behind while others prosper and grow at spectacular rates. We must encourage local initiatives and consider ambitious infrastructure projects to solve that problem on a local and national level."
 FRA_hydroelectricity:0 "Hydroelectricity"

 FRA_swiss_hydroelectricity:0 "Swiss Hydroelectricity"
 FRA_swiss_hydroelectricity_desc:0 "Our recent conquest of Romandie has opened up several perfect spots for hydroelectricity as an extension of our existing network in the Alpes. Our leading engineers are certain that expanding our dams in the region would be greatly beneficial to our economy."
 FRA_chemins_de_fer:0 "Office des Chemins de Fer"
 FRA_chemins_de_fer_desc:0 "A Congress meeting over the status of France's infrastructure at the BGT showed the disorganisation of our rail system and how backwards it became. The Congress agreed on the need to create a new office specifically tasked with the development and maintenance of our railways to connect all the parts of France together."
 FRA_mining_expansion:0 "Mining Expansion"
 FRA_mining_expansion_desc:0 "The economic and infrastructural development of the regions of the Alpes and the Massif Central allows for a greater exploitation of the mineral resources available there. Our prospectors discovered new mineral deposits and we are now ready to start exploiting them on an industrial scale!"
 FRA_plan_prost:0 "Plan Prost"
 FRA_plan_prost_desc:0 "The engineer and urbanist Henri Prost came up with a plan to develop highways around the Parisian region to link the outlying suburbs. This idea is receiving widespread support and the BGT decided to fund new projects to expand highways through the Commune. The communes of Marseille and Lyon also asked him to draw highway plans for their cities."
 FRA_autoroutes:0 "The Autoroutes"
 FRA_autoroutes_desc:0 "The highways proved a massive boon to the economy and worker mobility in urban regions, now an ambitious plan has been put forward to expand them to the whole country! Linking every corner of our country will have a massive impact on our regional development and can only benefit the Revolution."

 FRA_eco_direction:0 "Direction of the Economy"
 FRA_eco_direction_desc:0 "Our economy is fairer to the workers and generally quite potent while reactionary economies live and die on the whims of capitalists, but internal conflicts have prevented us from steering our economy. It is time to call for a meeting of the BGT, so that these questions are once and for all settled by one the Commune's faction."
 FRA_orth_syndicalism:0 "Orthodox Syndicalism"
 FRA_orth_syndicalism_desc:0 "The course set since the revolution has been reaffirmed. This orthodoxy has proven effective, and with a bit of fine-tuning can be even more so."
 FRA_reduce_unemploy:0 "Reducing Unemployment"
 FRA_reduce_unemploy_desc:0 "Beyond the Rhine, unemployment is at an all-time high, we must ensure that the French worker will always have a job to feed his family. In this simple task of providing our people with the fruit of their sustenance, we prove our inherent superiority to the capitalist economies and their constant crises."
 FRA_work_design_coop:0 "Worker-Designer Cooperation"
 FRA_work_design_coop_desc:0 "By increasing the cooperation between the scientists and engineers behind designs and concepts and the workers who actually build them, we will rapidly improve our production techniques. This also allows us to quickly train and educate our workforce to new techniques, by letting the designers directly teach the workers about them."
 FRA_improve_manage:0 "Improve Management of Unions"
 FRA_improve_manage_desc:0 "The Unions have for long been directing the economy, but they have some gaps and loopholes in their rules that can be exploited, leading to disastrous results for our economy. However, we will not question the place of the unions in our country. Instead, we will tighten management and rewrite some work codes."
 FRA_dedication:0 "Sense of Dedication"
 FRA_dedication_desc:0 "The worker has to realise that he is working for the greater good of the Commune and the French people as a whole. He must feel invested in his work at all times, and it is this way that we will improve our national spirit and our productivity. No need for whips or oppressive business owners."
 FRA_fac_towns:0 "Factory Towns"
 FRA_fac_towns_desc:0 "Our plan to rapidly expand the Commune's industrial base can be supported by the establishment of new factory towns, cities specially designed to provide housing and modern commodities to them and their families, while making sure they live close to their workplaces."
 FRA_Industrialisation:0 "Communal Industrialisation"
 FRA_Industrialisation_desc:0 "Ambroise Croizat is the new economy minister of the Commune. A Jacobin, he is a proponent of Communal Industrialisation. While our country has always been one of the modern economies of Europe, we cannot yet compare to the Ruhr Valley. Only by ambitious industrial base expansion can we hope to measure to Germany."
 FRA_inter_coop:0 "International Cooperation"
 FRA_inter_coop_desc:0 "While our technical expertise is one of the best in the world, it is too easy to ignore any breakthroughs that are made in friendly countries on a false pretence of superiority. From new production techniques to management theories, we must stay observant and borrow anything that could benefit our own economy."
 FRA_war_eco_agri:0 "War Economy and Agriculture"
 FRA_war_eco_agri_desc:0 "Jacques Doriot is the new economy minister of the Commune. A Sorelian, he is a proponent of his 'War, Economy and Agriculture' theory, calling for a rapid conversion to a war economy along with an ambitious development of the agriculture. Should the German reactionaries attack, we will certainly have a use for the rifles and the bread."
 FRA_modern_farms:0 "Modern Farms"
 FRA_modern_farms_desc:0 "Farming has been a staple of civilisation since ancient times, and yet it has profoundly changed in just one century. Recent tools like tractors allow a single farmer to harvest fields in a single day that would have required dozens of farmers and a week in the past. Let's mechanise our farms, to put more food in our platters and our rations."
 FRA_war_industry:0 "A War Industry"
 FRA_war_industry_desc:0 "Despite rising animosity from Germany, our economy is still mostly dedicated to the production of civilian goods and is not suited for a major war. We need to develop our production of arms and equipment if we are to defend the Commune against external threats efficiently."
 FRA_mass_production:0 "Mass Production"
 FRA_mass_production_desc:0 "Our enemies are many, and our army is quite large as a result. This army needs a lot of equipment, and this clearly puts a strain on our factories. We must search new ways to improve our production of small arms through both design and manufacturing, without cutting corners."
 FRA_cooperatives:0 "Cooperatives"
 FRA_cooperatives_desc:0 "Daniel Guérin is the new economy minister of the Commune. An Anarchiste, he is a proponent of Cooperatives. The Commune's government is primarily here to serve its workers, and it must ensure the best working conditions for them. Letting them manage their own companies is a good way to start."
 FRA_decentralized_industry:0 "Decentralised Industry"
 FRA_decentralized_industry_desc:0 "Our industry is currently concentrated around Paris and major communes, but the people don't live only in Paris, Lille or Lyon but everywhere in France. We must put all efforts into developing all the regions of France so that our entire country prospers."
 FRA_market_socialism:0 "Market Socialism"
 FRA_market_socialism_desc:0 "The cooperatives we created must insert themselves in a new, equal socialist market. This market will make the economy more dynamic and allow everyone to pursue their own goals and share their industrial wealth in the respect of the ideals of socialism, without the predatory behaviours of the capitalist market economy."
 FRA_ruralism:0 "Ruralism"
 FRA_ruralism_desc:0 "The life of the peasant is the best life known to man, but the need for an industrial economy made this life impossible for most of the French people. We can, however, still encourage this lifestyle by bringing their factories and workplaces to the countryside, ending the tyranny of mass urbanisation."

 FRA_communal_army:0 "The Communal Army"
 FRA_communal_army_desc:0 "The French nation has an army, but it is an army that still does not have a unifying direction. Some still propose the same army of the Weltkrieg with High Command. Others want more initiative to NCOs. Others still desire a motorised and mobile army. Finally, there is also the idea of mass conscription. Once we dissolve the military trade unions, we must follow with an unified vision."
 FRA_principe_concentration:0 "Principe de Concentration"
 FRA_principe_concentration_desc:0 "As the butcher of the Weltkieg showed, there is nothing to be won with evenly spreading our troops across the entire front, taking only metres that we lose the next day to artillery barrages. By making local breakthroughs and investing into them, we can literally shatter the entire enemy front with a few good battles."
 FRA_tank_research:0 "Tank Research Grants"
 FRA_tank_research_desc:0 "Tanks are not new to us, nor to the world, but they are still a relatively new component of warfare. Improvements have been brisk in tank construction during the interwar, and it seems the true potential of armour is starting to reveal itself. Let us invest generously into the future of warfare."
 FRA_fast_army:0 "Speed Cult"
 FRA_fast_army_desc:0 "Motorisation is more than the future of cavalry. While the average truck will not last long under enemy fire, it allows us to get our troops to the very frontlines in incredible times. We must make speed the goal of all our tactics, all our training, all our equipment. Celerity is opportunity."
 FRA_tank_assembly_line:0 "Tank Assembly Lines"
 FRA_tank_assembly_line_desc:0 "Tanks are a fearsome machine on the battlefield, but they are a very complex machine to build. By creating baseline quality standards, we can speed up production of armour and supply our tanks with large armoured divisions that will come down on the enemy like a brick."
 FRA_tank_quality_line:0 "Quality Production"
 FRA_tank_quality_line_desc:0 "Tanks are a fearsome machine on the battlefield, but they are a very complex machine to build. Regardless, if we prioritise quality, we ensure that our tanks are the best of the best. Thus, every tank we produce will easily crush the tin cans that our enemy desperately output to counter us."
 FRA_centralized_hc:0 "Centralised High Command"
 FRA_centralized_hc_desc:0 "We are aware that the unsavoury events of 1919 have put a deep mistrust of military High Command in the people of the Commune. Regardless, we will need to rehabilitate the concept of the High Command. The idea of the squad leader deciding combat tactics is glamorous, but who will care for logistics and strategic manoeuvres?"
 FRA_analysing_wki:0 "Analysing the Weltkrieg"
 FRA_analysing_wki_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg, a tragedy to us and our British comrades, is a painful topic to study, but it is one we must study regardless. From the successes and failures of this war, we will learn how the next must be fought. Those who think that new tactics and strategies will sprout out of nowhere as the conflict draws near are deluded."
 FRA_war_experience:0 "War Experience"
 FRA_war_experience_desc:0 "The French army has fought many wars, and will fight many more. Every time we must stop and reflect on these conflicts, and make an analysis as thorough as possible to find where our plans have went right or wrong. Just because they did not fight under the Commune's flag does not mean they died in vain."
 FRA_military_academy:0 "Military Academy"
 FRA_military_academy_desc:0 "War is a complex topic, one that must be studied to be fully understood. While we have found many talents during the 1919 Civil War, we must take the preliminary steps to train new officers. We can also study our whole doctrine and renew the training of our officer corps this way."
 FRA_officers_initiative:0 "Officer's Initiative"
 FRA_officers_initiative_desc:0 "How often during the Weltkrieg have breakthroughs been made but not exploited due to unresponsive officers? We must ensure this does not happen again, every regiment should be able to act independently, drawing up plans and acting on them as they see fit. This is the reality of modern warfare, Napoleonic columns are history."
 FRA_mission_type:0 "Mission Type Tactics"
 FRA_mission_type_desc:0 "Our plans are not meant to be task lists, else our troops are paralysed once the unexpected happens. Our plans must always be built with one specific goal in mind. This is the only rigid part of the plan, all else is left to squads to figure out. This way, we will always be ready to adapt our plans as the situation on the field develops."
 FRA_flexible_support:0 "Flexible Support"
 FRA_flexible_support_desc:0 "To ensure the efficiency of our squads, we must ensure they are served by artillery and support regiments in a flexible manner. This means that at any time artillery must be ready to fire on the orders of any squad linked to it, and support companies must be ready to intervene when called for help on the front."
 FRA_empower_rifleman:0 "Empower the Rifleman"
 FRA_empower_rifleman_desc:0 "Eventually, we can draft all the plans in the world and stack as many artillery guns in the backline as we see fit, but the humble Rifleman is the one who will win the war. By ensuring that even them can independently take initiative, we subtly improve the efficiency of every squad and defeat those enemies who use terror to lead them."
 FRA_mass_conscription:0 "Mass Mobilisation"
 FRA_mass_conscription_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg showed without a doubt that modern wars now take absolutely insane scales, drafting millions to fight on every side. Every Frenchman must know that one day, he may be called to defend his beloved country against the Reactionaries. We will only be defeated when the last of us perish!"
 FRA_improve_manufactures:0 "Improve the Manufactures"
 FRA_improve_manufactures_desc:0 "War truly has taken a massive scale, and such a modern war will need an amount of equipment that we perhaps cannot even fathom yet. To the rifle and grenade is added the tank and plane, soon perhaps more. We must ensure our military industry is the best it can possibly be, we will never have one too many rifles!"
 FRA_global_organization:0 "Global Organisation"
 FRA_global_organization_desc:0 "A grand army needs a grand command. However, it is not the High Command of old, sitting in a war room in Paris, drawing arrows on a map. It is the officers of every squad, of every regiment, of every army and of every front. All together, they will lead our army, and ensure our eventual victory in such a large conflict."
 FRA_mass_fire_support:0 "Mass Fire Support"
 FRA_mass_fire_support_desc:0 "With such a big army comes a new idea for the old concept of support fire. For long it was thought that artillery alone could support a push, but we believe that it is the duty of every squad that is not attacking to provide covering fires for those who push forward. This way, our enemies will forever duck as we move forwards."
 FRA_grand_army_reform:0 "Grand Army Reform"
 FRA_grand_army_reform_desc:0 "Our army is now united in purpose and in doctrine. No more does anyone dare call them a militia or street rabble. This brings back to the imagery of the Grande Armée, and indeed it is a legacy we are proud of. Let us ensure our whole army organisation is geared towards handling this many soldiers and officers."

 FRA_equipment_modern:0 "Modern Equipment"
 FRA_equipment_modern_desc:0 "The tools of war are ever improving, more efficient, more deadly. To some, this is a tragedy, but it is clear that we cannot shun them. War is an ugly reality, and we must face it. By ensuring our equipment is always the best, we make conflicts deadlier, perhaps. But our enemies will not spare us the courtesy of using those weapons on us."
 FRA_special_forces:0 "Alpine Forces"
 FRA_special_forces_desc:0 "Mountains have always been a radically different environment to fight in, and most of our borders cross mountains. We must ensure that our training of mountain forces is spotless, and that every new piece of equipment we invent is adapted to mountain warfare. Mountain artillery exists, perhaps mountain tanks soon will?"
 FRA_tank_division:0 "Tank Divisions"
 FRA_tank_division_desc:0 "It has been obvious for a while, but tanks are here to stay. Their armour is impenetrable to small arms fire, and their mighty cannon destroys whatever it is aimed at. As years go own, their designs become heavier and more destructive. We must stay on the forefront of tank technology, so that we may dominate the battlefield."
 FRA_road_to_war:0 "The Road to War"
 FRA_road_to_war_desc:0 "The war with Germany is clearly inevitable, this nation holds hostage our brothers in Alsace and Lorraine, and with its many puppets in the Reichspakt it stands as the main counter-revolutionary power in Europe, if not the world, tyrant over hundreds of millions of people. This will stop, we will avenge them all. The first Weltkrieg was not the last."
 FRA_renseignements_generaux:0 "The Renseignements Généraux"
 FRA_renseignements_generaux_desc:0 "It has become clearly obvious that we cannot defend our country in a satisfactory manner without a modern, centralised intelligence agency. The taboos of old still hold against such centralised, unscrutinised authority, but it is a sacrifice we have to make. German spies laugh softly at our pitiful 'intelligence committees'."
 FRA_military_buildup:0 "Military Build-up"
 FRA_military_buildup_desc:0 "To prepare for the upcoming war, we will need to develop our war industry rapidly and efficiently. This may damage our short term economic growth, and this may not be popular for those in our populace who hope for peace and prosperity, but we sadly know better. The survival of the Revolution is at stake here!"
 FRA_military_buildup_two:0 "Calibrating the Economy"
 FRA_military_buildup_two_desc:0 "The capitalist world is still struggling with last year's shattering economic crisis whilst the righteousness of our own system continues to prove itself. It has been suggested that we utilise this industrial advantage to transform certain aspects of the economy exclusively towards military purposes."
 FRA_socialist_education:0 "Socialist Education"
 FRA_socialist_education_desc:0 "The education of the French Republic was in many ways excellent, allowing the average citizen to obtain a large knowledge in the sciences and arts. We seek to continue working on this legacy by ensuring that French schools always have learning and education as their primary goal, not hierarchy and discipline like in some reactionary countries."
 FRA_Our_time_has_come:0 "Revanchist Propaganda"
 FRA_Our_time_has_come_desc:0 "Our desire of revenge against Germany has been long coming. 1871 saw us lose Alsace-Lorraine, and the Republican schools rightfully taught their children that it was a French region soon to be seized back. Sadly, 1919 saw our defeat and the loss of Belfort and Briey. But we are not done, our rightful anger shall only end when France is whole again!"
 FRA_department_revolutionary_ideals:0 "Department of Revolutionary Ideals"
 FRA_department_revolutionary_ideals_desc:0 "While the empirical teachings prove themselves easily, the virtues of the Commune are harder to communicate to our population.

 FRA_Blanqui_Research_Institute:0 "Blanqui Research Institute"
 FRA_Blanqui_Research_Institute_desc:0 "While some nations resist the teachings of science, France endorses them without nuance. Let's support the establishment of a new research institute aimed at furthering our technological superiority. Where reactionaries doubt every discovery and stand wary of change, we embrace them and become stronger every year!"
 FRA_military_buildup_three:0 "Further Military Development"
 FRA_military_buildup_three_desc:0 "Our economy is now well developed and the Commune is ready for war, but we can always do better. By encouraging further industrial projects, the Commune shall not only be ready for war but will indisputably be superior in every way to any of our enemies. We will prove to the world that the Commune will not be defeated!"
 FRA_military_science:0 "Military Science"
 FRA_military_science_desc:0 "France is always working on improving its research networks, but theoretical sciences can only bring us so far. We will open a new wing in the Blanqui research institute dedicated to military science, allowing us to fund and develop new breakthroughs that will be immediately put to use by our army."
 FRA_synthetic_refineries:0 "Synthetic Resources"
 FRA_synthetic_refineries_desc:0 "France is great and resourceful, but it does not have everything. Oil, rubber, tungsten and chromium are all lacking and we must not rely on foreign exporters when conflict comes. We must research new ways to acquire these resources from what we already have. Some scientists even suggest we may be able to engineer those resources."
 FRA_secret_weaponry:0 "Electric Machines"
 FRA_secret_weaponry_desc:0 "While computing traces back to the tabulating machine, we have since made massive breakthroughs in the field of computing.

 FRA_nuclear_weapons:0 "Curie Project"
 FRA_nuclear_weapons_desc:0 "While the Damocles Project held great promise, the refusal by the Union of Britain to take part crippled the cooperation between our scientists and theirs.

 FRA_German_borders:0 "Fortify the German Border"
 FRA_German_borders_desc:0 "We have already built a fairly impressive network of fortifications along the Meuse river and the border with Flanders-Wallonia. Regardless, we can improve it with new constructions and cutting-edge military installations like radio stations and modern artillery guns. Something the Republic would have never bothered to do, surely."
 FRA_extend_line:0 "Extend the Line"
 FRA_extend_line_desc:0 "While we have mostly focused our fortification efforts on those segments of the line that are the most defensible, it is quite obvious that Germany will target our weaker points instead.

 FRA_Demand_Romandy_desc:0 "The illegal Swiss occupation of Haute-Savoie has gone on for far too long!

 FRA_war_with_spain_desc:0 "Right at our southern border, just across the Pyrenees, capitalism and imperialism still persists.

 FRA_War_with_germany_desc:0 "Much to our surprise, the German reactionaries have ceded Alsace-Lorraine. But we never intended to just stop there!

 FRA_War_with_austria_desc:0 "The Austrian peoples have proven their incapability to commence a successful socialist revolution in their country and liberate themselves from the Habsburg tyranny.

 FRA_mission_bhartiya_desc:0 "The Bharatiya Commune asked for our support in their struggle against its neighbours, the Delhi imperialists and the Princely Federation reactionaries.

 FRA_arab_committee:0 "Socialist Anti-Colonial Committee"
 FRA_arab_committee_desc:0 "The traitors of the French people, bastard Petain and his clique of friends, use the native proletariat in efforts to return to the mainland.

The reactionaries can gawk, we will surely have the last laugh."
 FRA_avantgarde:0 "International Avant-Garde"
 FRA_avantgarde_desc:0 "For too long have traditional arts and classical music dominated the entertainment of the masses.

 FRA_second_inter_congress:0 "The Second Internationale Congress"
 FRA_second_inter_congress_desc:0 "With the Second American Civil War raging on, as well as a number of other conflicts ready to break out at any time across the world, the Internationale has to consider its approach towards the Global Revolution. Since the first Congress of the Internationale took place in France, the second one will take place in Britain."
 FRA_scientific_cooperation:0 "International Scientific Cooperation"
 FRA_scientific_cooperation_desc:0 "It is clear that we cannot simply keep our own technological discoveries to ourselves.

 FRA_third_inter_congress_desc:0 "The responsibility of holding the Third Congress has once again fallen back to us, with the new site chosen for the task being the Palace Populaire, where the Louvre once stood full of the plunders of the French Empire.

 FRA_amateur_pilots:0 "Amateur Pilots"
 FRA_amateur_pilots_desc:0 "No-one is born a pilot, and while some study to excel at air handling and combat and their efforts are admirable, we cannot expect every single pilot to be an ace.

 FRA_valin_doctrine_desc:0 "Martial Valin is a brilliant aviator, and he has much to teach us about this new, strange world of air warfare. While his words are no gospel, we heavily value his unique experience and aim to make his teachings the frame of future air doctrine. A start, certainly."
 FRA_ecole_air:0 "École de l'Air"
 FRA_ecole_air_desc:0 "As our air doctrine rapidly expands and air fights go from disorganised brawls to carefully crafted engagements, we desperately begin to need trained pilots and trained officers who can plan air campaigns as they plan land or naval campaigns. Only our wits will work in this brand new field of warfare, and luckily we have some."
 FRA_air_bases:0 "Establish More Air Bases"
 FRA_air_bases_desc:0 "Planes require air bases to land, refuel, rearm, repair and take off, much like navies. But unlike navies, they cannot stay airborne for months, only hours. As such, we must ensure our air base coverage is excellent, and we must make sure we are always under capacity so that our air force is never crippled by lacking infrastructure."
 FRA_fighters:0 "Fighter Focus"
 FRA_fighters_desc:0 "The air is a new, vast angle of attack for our enemies, and as such it is a new angle of defence for us. Unlike on land, there are no forts, no cover, just one-on-one dogfights. If we invest in fighter production, we ensure no-one will freely navigate our air. Our fighters will always be upon them and ready to bring them back to the ground."
 FRA_bombers:0 "Bomber Focus"
 FRA_bombers_desc:0 "The air is a new, vast angle of attack for us, and it is one our enemies might not defend adequately against yet. Bombs present a single yet elegant way of transporting ordnance from the hangar to the target. We must invest in bombers to ensure that our enemies are assaulted from all sides, an advantage we cannot ignore."
 FRA_strat_bombers:0 "Strategic Destruction Focus"
 FRA_strat_bombers_desc:0 "If one bomb works well against an enemy, then ten bombs must only work better. Further development in bomber models have unveiled new air frames capable of carrying massive amounts of bombs, or a few devastatingly big bombs. Whatever the case, we may soon flatten entire cities or armies with a few waves of air attacks."
 FRA_paratrooper_focus:0 "Paratroopers Development"
 FRA_paratrooper_focus_desc:0 "Until now, we have always considered that the only way to transport troops are trucks and landing craft.

We must immediately train regiments capable of this vertical encirclement!"
 FRA_rocket_development:0 "Rocketry Effort"
 FRA_rocket_development_desc:0 "The rocket engine is the pinnacle of our research in new propulsion methods for aircraft. While the path to creating rocket craft might still be long and arduous, our scientists propose a simpler use for rockets.

 FRA_navy_focus:0 "Naval Reorganisation Programme"
 FRA_navy_focus_desc:0 "While we currently have an acceptable navy, it is quite disorganised, preventing us from expanding it any further.

 FRA_new_doctrine:0 "The New Doctrine"
 FRA_new_doctrine_desc:0 "Our navy is a tool, to be applied carefully when the situation calls for it.

 FRA_castex_plan:0 "The Castex Plan"
 FRA_castex_plan_desc:0 "The Castex Plan aims for us to continue improving the core of our navy. Battleships and cruisers will be the striking force of our grand navy, allowing us to end any fight with the rout of our enemy, with little damage to us except for screen ships such as Destroyers."

 comfrance.1.d:0 "The Third Republic ended the way it began: defeated by German arms and facing communist revolution at home. In the November of 1919, a revolutionary General Strike was called by the CGT, paralysing the country and causing the downfall of the bourgeois government. 'The Party of Order' was not strong enough to put an end to the unrest and in subsequent months the French Establishment was forced out of France by a coalition of leftist forces in a brief but brutal civil war.\n\nFor the past fifteen years, the self-styled 'Commune of France' has united behind a common platform of Syndicalist-Socialist consensus, headed by the ruling Comité de Salut Public. However, by 1936, the consensus that was reached in order to rebuild the shattered country and defend the fruits of revolution from foreign menace is being deemed as increasingly outdated by many critics, and there are growing calls for more radical policies. France is increasingly confident in her security and in her mission, but the French revolutionary tradition is disparate, and it is unclear precisely which ideological strands shall become dominant in the years to come..."

This has resulted in the incumbent Chief of Staff, the popular civil war general Maurice Gamelin, having to step down.

As much as colonial domination over our former territories in North Africa isn't to please us, this initiative is worrisome. It is likely the Commune will fight to put forward revolutionaries and nationalists sympathetic to the syndicalist cause.

Those strikes are different than what we are used to, they are only done by a small part of the workers and don't seem to have any clear motive, factory bosses throughout the country only woke up to an occupied factory and to a lot of the equipment smashed. In other factories, the workers weren't occupying the factory, but a large part of the machinery was still found damaged or destroyed. Repressing the strikes and arresting their participants wasn't too difficult, but it seems to be a shot in the dark as those incidents were clearly masterminded from elsewhere..."

This all evidently coming from the Commune of France, using the darkness of the night to smuggle arms into our territory, destabilise us and incite rebellion. We took too long however to uncover that scheme, and the revolutionaries are now well armed enough to be emboldened in their resistance. We only have to hope we will be able to weather the storm."

Propaganda, even more when supported by the Commune of France, is hard to stop, we can't possibly confiscate every leaflet spreading in our colonies. This isn't entirely a lost battle though, as we can try to focus on a specific region in which our agents will shut down the radios and confiscate every suspect document. By doing this, we will be at least able to reduce the effects of the campaign in one or two regions of our choice..."

Blum, being both a lawyer and excellent public speaker, has used the courtroom to make a brilliant indictment of the Jacobin regime. Gamelin has remained silent throughout; refusing to recognise the court's right to try him.\n\nThe trial has not gone according to plan and the defendants have, despite heavy manipulation of the proceedings, proven largely successful in rebutting the charges, and won sympathetic coverage in both the unofficial domestic and international press. It has become such an embarrassment to our Communist regime that some of the leadership is considering ordering it called off.

 comfrance.170.t:0 "An Alliance with the Internationale?"
 comfrance.170.d:0 "The Internationale, the military alliance of the world’s foremost socialist powers, has discreetly approached us with an offer to join its ranks, considering an alliance with our nation to be in the interest of all and a great step forward in the long struggle towards the liberation of the international proletariat. This offer comes with undeniable benefits, we could certainly expect a great amount of support: help against our enemies and towards the realisation of our military objectives, protection should it ever be needed, and just as importantly, support for the development of our armed forces and even our economy through the Phalanstère program. However, it comes with perhaps daunting obligations, setting us on a course of eventual but certain conflict with the Kaiser and his allies. How should we respond to their offer?"
 comfrance.170.a:0 "Stronger together!"
 comfrance.170.b:0 "On second thought, no..."

 comfrance.171.d.accept:0 "Time to rejoice! [From.GetNameDefCap] has accepted our offer to join our military alliance, as we had dearly hoped they would. With this decision, they have been assured of our undying support as allies in the global struggle for the liberation of the working class, and we have gained a valuable ally against our undeniably mighty enemies. Soon, many others will follow them: “the Internationale shall be the human race”!"
 comfrance.171.d.refuse:0 "To our chagrin, [From.GetNameDef] has refused our offer to join our military alliance. Perhaps too intimidated by the undeniable might of our enemies, or simply not committed enough to the fight for the liberation of the proletariat. In any case, though this is certainly a regrettable result of our diplomatic overture, many others will join us in this struggle: “the Internationale shall be the human race”!"
 comfrance.171.a:0 "Excellent!"
 comfrance.171.b:0 "Their loss."

 comfrance.1000.t:0 "Gamelin Marches on Paris"
 comfrance.1000.d:0 "A few days ago, General Maurice Gamelin, launched a successful coup against the Jacobin regime of Marcel Déat. While this seems like a staunch attack on the commune’s democratic system, many argue that the Jacobins would have destroyed the democratic system if not for Gamelin’s intervention. Gamelin has promised to restore France to traditional syndicalism, and the process of De-Jacobinisation is already taking place. It is still unknown how his plans will turn out. We can only wait..."
 comfrance.1000.a:0 "Surprising, to say the least."
