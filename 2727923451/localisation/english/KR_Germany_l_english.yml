### Leaders ###
 POLITICS_WILHELM_II_DESC:0 "Wilhelm II von Hohenzollern, the 'Father of the Reichspakt', has ruled the German Empire for nearly 50 years. His reign has seen the rise of Germany to the status of foremost world power, and is considered to have brought on the 'German Golden Age.' Since the Weltkrieg, Germany has eclipsed its rivals, and its drive to acquire a place in the sun has been fulfilled. Even if dark clouds loom over the horizon, Kaiser Wilhelm has the support of his people, his military, and the aristocracy which lord over both."
 POLITICS_WILLY_3_DESC:0 "Emperor Wilhelm III, despite lacklustre performance as commander of Germany's Army Group B during the Weltkrieg, was hailed as a hero upon his return home. With the death of his father, Wilhelm the war hero was enthroned as the new Emperor of Germany. Wilhelm is a friend and ally of Kurt von Schleicher, and affirms the importance of the aristocracy in governance."

 POLITICS_GERD_VON_RUNDSTEDT_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nDecember 12th, 1875, in Aschersleben, Province of Saxony, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn to a dynasty of Prussian nobility whose men all served in the military since Frederick the Great, Gerd von Rundstedt did not stray from this tradition - his path since maturity strayed little from the ordinary Prussian noble officer, first the Kadettenanstalt Oranienstein, then Royal Prussian Main Cadet Institute at Groß-Lichterfelde, in Berlin. Commissioned as an infantry officer, he made a good impression on his superiors for outstanding ability and so began to climb the ranks. At the beginning of the Weltkrieg, he was the 22nd Division's Chief of Staff - throughout the course of the war, he saw little action, mostly serving in various staff positions, but with a high reputation among his peers.\n\nAfter the war, he used this good impression and connections to climb the ranks again, ultimately reaching the rank of Generaloberst. A competent and experienced commander respected by pretty much everyone in the General Staff, von Rundstedt is also perhaps the most apolitical - no matter what the topic or issue may be, his view is that the Army must stay out of any political affairs. After all, Prussian field marshals never mutiny."
 POLITICS_RUPPRECHT_VON_BAYERN_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nMay 18th, 1869, in Munich, Kingdom of Bavaria\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nThe incumbent King of Bavaria, Rupprecht Maria Luitpold Ferdinand, is also one of the most decorated commanders of the Imperial German Army during the Weltkrieg. Trained as an infantry officer in the Bavarian Army, he eventually rose to command the Bavarian I Army Corps, all while travelling extensively, taking up carpentry, and fulfilling his duties as a prince of the Bavarian royal family. In 1913, he became the heir apparent of the Kingdom, and a year later, he was assigned to lead the German Sixth Army during the Schlieffen Plan. Though his assignment was made due to his royal status, he proved to be an able and innovative commander. At the same time, however, he used his military command to push for Bavarian interests - refusing to withdraw his army from the Western Front to defend Prussia and thus forcing the General Staff to move troops from Belgium instead.\n\nIn July 1916, he was promoted to Generalfeldmarschall and was assigned to command the Army Group Rupprecht, a rank he has held onto until today. In 1921, after the passing of his father, Ludwig III of Bavaria, Rupprecht was crowned as the new King of Bavaria, and since then reigns as a constitutional monarch with respect for the laws and institutions of his homeland. Though having to occupy two chairs at once may seem exhausting for some, the King seems none worse for wear, and dutifully awaits Germany's next great war."
 POLITICS_AUGUST_VON_MACKENSEN_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nDecember 6th, 1849, in Leipnitz, Province of Saxony, Kingdom of Prussia\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nThe oldest general in the Imperial German Army, known as 'the Last Hussar', August Mackensen came from a middle-class upbringing in rural Prussia. His father, an agricultural administrator, hoped for his son to follow the same career path, but he instead volunteered for the Prussian army and served with distinction in the Franco-Prussian War. In the years following the war, Mackensen broke expectations one after the other, bypassing the three-year preparation period for the General Staff and later serving as an adjutant to Wilhelm II himself, the first commoner to do so. On the Kaiser's 40th birthday, he was ennobled, becoming August von Mackensen, and was assigned to command XVII Army Corps - a prestigious position, as Crown Prince Wilhelm now served under him.\n\nDuring the Weltkrieg, he was one of Germany's most successful and prestigious commanders, assigned to front after front in Europe - Galicia, Serbia, and finally Romania, shattering Entente resistance in all three campaigns. He returned to Germany a war hero and a Generalfeldmarschall, and continued to serve in the Army thenceforth. By now, however, von Mackensen is over eighty years old, his sharpness has dulled and his body is no longer as able as it once was - most assume retirement is coming soon, the only thing that matters is when."
 POLITICS_WILHELM_III_GENERAL_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nMay 6th, 1882, in the Marmorpalais of Potsdam, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nThe heir apparent of the German Empire since the age of six, Crown Prince Wilhelm is a decorated commander in the Imperial German Army in his own right. A modern royal well-liked within German society, a competent equestrian and a student of administrative law, he began his career in the army in 1911, commissioned to command the 1st Life Hussar Regiment. When the Weltkrieg began, he rose to command the 5th Army, and then the Army Group Kronprinz Wilhelm, despite his young age and lack of military experience. His influence in decision-making on the front was minimal, however, and Wilhelm instead used the prestige of his position to support Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff - he described the ousting of Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg as "the most beautiful day of his life".\n\nCrown Prince Wilhelm returned from the Western Front a war hero and continued his duties as the heir apparent. In the post-war years, he has retained his position in the Army, while growing increasingly close with the German right wing - especially Kurt von Schleicher, who is a friend and ally of Wilhelm's."

 POLITICS_ERICH_VON_MANSTEIN_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nNovember 24th, 1887, in Berlin, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn as von Lewinski, Erich von Manstein comes from the family of a noble Prussian general with Kashubian heritage, and is the nephew of Paul von Hindenburg. Much like the rest of his extended family, he followed a career in the military. After six years in the cadet corps in Plön and Groß-Lichterfelde, he was commissioned into the Third Foot Guards Regiment - and reached the Weltkrieg as an infantry lieutenant enrolled in the Prussian War Academy. The war put an end to his studies and sent him to the front - both East and West, to several fronts and several world-renown campaigns, ending with the victorious march into France in 1919.\n\nAfter the end of the war, Manstein remained in the army and continued climbing the ranks, having shown his talent and intelligence in the years prior. As a newly inducted member of the General Staff, he toured countries across Europe to study their military facilities and breakthroughs in new tactics, all while developing his own. Regarded as an innovative commander with a knack for unorthodox strategies, he is one of the main proponents of combined arms, mobile warfare in the German army."

It would take a great deal for them to admit defeat in the coming war... Though there are some who suggest that Germany's resilience is more brittle than it appears.

The 78 year old monarch saw Germany victorious in the Second Weltkrieg and continued rise on the world stage as an economic, technological, and military power.

The KAPD (Communist Workers' Party) was formed in April 1920 as a split from the KPD based upon tactical and political differences, with the most important one being the KAPD's strong council-communist bent, anti-parliamentarianism and their tactics of 'leadership by example', decried as adventurist by the KPD majority. The KAPD's primary ally is the KAUD, formed in 1931 as a merger of the anti-trade union organisation AAUD (Allgemeine Arbeiter-Union Deutschland, General Workers' Union of Germany) and the AAUD-E (Allgemeine Arbeiter-Union – Einheitsorganisation, General Workers' Union of Germany - Unitary Organisation). Both the KAPD and KAUD express their support for 'Unionen', unions that are formed based upon economic regions, not trades, unlike the traditional 'Gewerkschaften'. These 'Unionen' are made out of factory organizations (Betriebsorganisationen, BO). They also both support the formation of a unitary organisation for the proletariat, however most agree that this is not possible currently and thus are willing to maintain the KAPD as a 'necessary evil' (the AAUD-E demanded immediate unification and thus split from the AAUD in 1921, which however after becoming fully decimated re-unified with the AAUD). The organizations insist that the revolution is not a task of a party, but the task of the proletariat, seeing the KAPD's role as merely being a catalyst for their action, with the task of the KAUD being meanwhile to fight against the traditional trade unions and take control of the workplaces.§!

The SPD was regularly fought by the conservative establishment, with the two most important ones being the suppression of the SPD under Bismarck and later Ludendorff. Before the First World War, the SPD was the strongest party in the Reichstag. During the War, however, the SPD split in two; the moderate MSPD and the more radical anti-war USPD. After a failed peaceful revolution in September 1918, both parties once more reconciled and reunited under the banner of the SPD. The SPD was the most vocal opponent of the Ludendorff dictatorship and the target of many government-instructed sanctions.    SPD representatives were present at the dismissal of the dictator and many people within the Empire attribute the fall of the dictatorship to them. Under Germany’s "second-greatest" chancellor, Alfred von Tirpitz, the SPD also has had to struggle against increasing levels of wealth among workers leading to decreased electoral output even in former core territories. The SPD's voter block is mostly among the lower classes and the industrial areas along the Rhine in the Kingdom of Saxony and in cities in Silesia, but Elsaß-Lothringen is also proving to be a hotbed of German social democracy, especially after the decline of the Zentrum and the ongoing centralisation efforts of the government.§!"

After Ludendorff's fall and the rise of Tirpitz, the NLP joined Tirpitz's great coalition, with it supporting German colonialism, expansion of the military, and liberal economic policies in the government.

The Zentrum was opposed to the Ludendorff dictatorships, though it refrained from supporting protests.

After the 1928 elections, Kuno von Westarp, under the pressure of the growing DVLP began the process of modernising the DkP to also attract urban right-wing voters and reform into a conservative-tent party. With it even backing an expansion of social welfare, though it also is in favour of cutting spending, except for agricultural subsidies. After the surprising death of von Tirpitz in 1930, the Kaiser picked von Westarp as his successor. Following two years of uneventful rule, the German electorate voted to let von Westarp be the new administrator and keeper of its wealth. Kuno von Westarp has done as was demanded, and the last few years have been quiet, with as little change as possible. The party continues to support the centralisation of the Empire and strictly opposes voting reforms.§!"

The DVLP was the most prominent supporter of the Ludendorff dictatorship, though there were some differences in opinion over economic issues. When the Ludendorff dictatorship was removed, Alfred von Tirpitz was picked by Wilhelm as his successor, with him creating a Great Coalition of right-wing parties to solve the issues brought on by the Ludendorff dictatorship. This moderation of the party caused a lot of upset from the right-wing of the party, manifesting itself when they took over the party in the wake of the death of von Tirpitz. However, this takeover caused many supporters of the DVLP to abandon the party in favour of the DkP and DRP. The DVLP advocates for pan-Germanism, anti-parliamentarianism, anti-socialism and anti-semitism.§!"

### Domestic Events ###

 gerdom.1.t:0 "The Constitution of the German Kaiserreich"
 gerdom.1.d:0 "After the crushing defeat of the Second French Empire by forces of the North German Federation, our constitution was signed in 1871 by representatives of the Federation and four other states in southern Germany. The new constitutional framework created integrated the southern states into the Prussian-led Federation, thus giving the enlarged entity a new identity as the Deutsches Reich.\n\nAccording to the constitution, the Empire is a federation of twenty-five German states. The title of Bundespräsidium, or Federation President, was held by the King of Prussia, a figure now invested with the title of Emperor of Germany. The Emperor directly appoints the Chancellor, the head of government and chairman of the Bundesrat, the council of representatives of the German states. Laws are enacted by both the Bundesrat and the Reichstag, the lower house Imperial Diet elected by male Germans above the age of 25 years.\n\nWith an option to dissolve the Reichstag on a whim, it is clear that the main political power in the German Empire actually rests not in Reichstag, elected by the people, but in the hands of the non-elected German Emperor. Another issue is the Prussian three-class voting system, which has remained mostly unchanged since 1849.\n\nOver sixty years after the founding of the Kaiserreich, the liberals and social democrats are growing increasingly disgruntled with the status quo and our constitution may need revision soon to help us weather the upcoming turbulence..."

The hero of the Intervention in China passed away peacefully in his sleep.\n\nOur nation is mourning the loss of a true German hero, and every important dignitary was in attendance at his funeral in Berlin. Afterwards, the Chief of the Army, August von Mackensen, could be seen whispering something to the Kaiser in private.

### Agricultural crisis in Mitteleuropa ###

 gerdom.11.t:0 "Agricultural Crisis in Mitteleuropa"
 gerdom.11.d:0 "During this time of great crisis, the complacent agricultural sector of the German economy has proven to be particularly vulnerable to the economic downturn. With this in mind several Junkers, representing the landed nobility of the Kingdom of Prussia, have asked for protectionist legislation and state subsidies for their agricultural production. By imposing tariffs on foreign produce, we will strengthen this vital sector of the Reich's economy and protect our farmers. Unfortunately, such a measure is likely to cause further damage to the economy of our neighbours, dependent as they are on German markets for their food exports. The wheat crop in the Ukraine is particularly vulnerable, and choosing to enact protectionist measures might seriously damage them and our other agrarian partners."

In these troubled times for the Empire, we must be careful in formulating a policy response liable to cause domestic tensions. Granting the suffragists what they ask would anger the more conservative elements of our government, particularly members of the Reichstag, a body currently elected solely by universal male suffrage. On the other hand, a stern refusal followed by reprisals may lead to further protests and riots, especially in the more liberal states, many of which already permit female voting in regional assemblies."

Some of them have proven fundamental to our propaganda efforts with very many of them began working in factories to relieve the men that had to leave and fight the enemy at the front. Their contribution has been invaluable and they have proven their ability and independence time and time again. For these reasons, the suffragist movement is stronger than ever and asking once again that the government grant women the right to vote and to run for office."

 gerdom.14.d:0 "With the devastating economic situation, many families struggle to earn their daily bread and the social security net is strained to the breaking point. In recent weeks the streets of many German cities have been increasingly terrorised by gangs of teenagers. These 'Halbstarke' steal products from the markets and shops, and often money from innocent pedestrians, or commit acts of vandalism to escape boredom and frustration. Few citizens feel safe on the streets anymore and it is clear that what some in the government might see merely as low-level civic disorder instead has the makings of total societal breakdown."

 gerdom.49.c:0 "A new face from the DkP - Carl Friedrich Gördeler!"

 gerdom.51.t:0 "The Security of the Reich"
 gerdom.51.d:0 "With our Vaterland now at war with the Commune of France and its Internationale allies, the Prime Minister has put forward a statute intending to disband all openly dangerous elements within our society, which includes leading elements of the SPD leadership! It is now up to the Kaiser to decide on this controversial subject!"
 gerdom.51.a:0 "Disband the socialists and other malcontents and arrest their ringleaders."
 gerdom.51.b:0 "Ich sehe keine Parteien mehr, sondern nur noch Deutsche!"

### General Strike ###

 gerdom.52.t:0 "The FAUD"
 gerdom.52.d:0 "The Freie Arbeiterunion Deutschlands, or Free Worker's Union of Germany, is an umbrella organisation of several trade unions founded during the turbulent period in 1919 during the French Revolution. They have repeatedly denounced the Syndicalist terror and therefore been allowed to operate unimpeded until now. However, our intelligence services have produced definite proof that their leaders are in contact with Syndicalist organisations in other nations, such as the CNT-FAI in Spain. We also suspect that some members may be directly plotting against the Kaiser!"
 gerdom.52.a:0 "Jail the leaders and ban the party. Force them underground!"
 gerdom.52.b:0 "Allow them to continue operating, but watch them closely..."

 gerdom.53.t:0 "Germany Bans the FAUD"
 gerdom.53.d:0 "The Free Worker's Union of Germany, or Freie Arbeiter Union Deutschlands, is an Anarcho-Syndicalist trade union that has been operating in Germany since its creation on September 15, 1919. They had been free to operate but the German government has just decided to arrest its leaders and ban the organisation. How should we react?"
 gerdom.53.a:0 "It is too early to confront Germany."
 gerdom.53.b:0 "We must defend our brothers in Germany! Solidarity!"

 gerdom.54.t:0 "Rhineland Unrest!"
 gerdom.54.d:0 "Workers in the Rhineland are protesting against the recent anti-leftist actions of our government, especially the scandalous crackdown on the FAUD which many Rhenish citizens had viewed as a legitimate institution free of serious Syndicalist influence and strong in its support for the working man."
 gerdom.54.a:0 "Hopefully this will not cause tragedy!"

 gerdom.55.t:0 "Worker's Unrest in the Rhineland!"
 gerdom.55.d:0 "Workers in western Germany are protesting against their oppressive government! This might be a chance to weaken our mortal enemy if we are prepared for the possible consequences of such a choice."
 gerdom.55.a:0 "We must help them!"
 gerdom.55.b:0 "We are not ready for this."

 gerdom.56.t:0 "General Strike in the Rhineland!"
 gerdom.56.d:0 "Angered by our previous actions aimed against labour fronts the workers have launched massive demonstrations throughout the Rhineland. A major police station in Mainz was burned down in a suspected arson attack and a shell factory near Landau smashed up by angry workers. These demonstrations are seriously undermining our military production and endangering the stability of our most important industrial region."
 gerdom.56.a:0 "Send in the army to deal with the strike!"
 gerdom.56.b:0 "Negotiate with the workers."

 gerdom.57.t:0 "Rhenish Strikers Cave!"
 gerdom.57.d:0 "The slow war of attrition between us and the strikers has been won by the government. The strikers, seeing little success in their efforts, have decided to call off the strike."
 gerdom.57.a:0 "Great!"

 gerdom.58.t:0 "Rhineland Strike Negotiations"
 gerdom.58.d:0 "An attempt to negotiate with the striking workers has been made. With all major political groups in the country closely watch the meeting, some are even hoping that the strike will set a precedent for further reforms in the Empire."
 gerdom.58.a:0 "Stall the negotiations and send in the army!"
 gerdom.58.b:0 "Reach a partial agreement."
 gerdom.58.c:0 "Reach a complete agreement."

 gerdom.59.t:0 "Rhenish Workers Return to the Factories"
 gerdom.59.d:0 "With the crisis resolved the factories may return to their previous efficiency."
 gerdom.59.a:0 "Splendid!"

 gerdom.60.t:0 "Rhenish Workers Return to the Factories"
 gerdom.60.d:0 "Thankfully, our armed forces were able to suppress the revolting workers, forcing them to abandon their hopeless struggle."
 gerdom.60.a:0 "Splendid!"

 gerdom.61.t:0 "Syndicalist Involvement in the General Strike"
 gerdom.61.d:0 "Although the general strike in the Rhineland is finally over an official inquiry into the event has suggested that a number of rebellious workers were supplied from abroad. Agitators, likely French Communards, handed out military-grade equipment and distributed Syndicalist propaganda to the masses. How should we react to this insolence?"
 gerdom.61.a:0 "We cannot tolerate such insolence!"
 gerdom.61.b:0 "We need solid proof of Syndicalist involvement."

### Death Events ###

 gerdom.62.t:0 "Johann von Bernstorff Dies"

 gerdom.63.t:0 "Wilhelm Groener Dies"
 gerdom.63.d:0 "One of the heroes of the Weltkrieg and the victor over the Bolsheviks during the Russian Intervention, Feldmarschall Wilhelm Groener has passed away today. All Germany is in mourning for one of the great generals of the post-Weltkrieg Golden Age."

 gerdom.64.t:0 "Ludwig von Reuter Dies"
 gerdom.64.d:0 "A hero of the Weltkrieg and commander of the Kaiserliche Marine, Ludwig von Reuter has died today. Famed for his actions during the battle of the Skagerrak and decisive actions against the British blockade, the German nation is in mourning."

 gerdom.65.t:0 "Wilhelm Souchon Dies"
 gerdom.65.d:0 "Admiral Wilhelm Souchon, a hero of the Weltkrieg and a Großadmiral in both our fleet and the Ottoman fleet, has passed away today. Souchon initially commanded the small Mediterranean Fleet before daringly handing his forces to the Ottomans and precipitating their entry into the war as a Central Power."

 gerdom.66.t:0 "Georg Bruchmüller Dies"
 gerdom.66.d:0 "Feldmarschall Bruchmüller a hero of the Weltkrieg and key developer of modern artillery tactics, has passed away today. Known to all as 'Breakthrough Müller' for his decisive actions during campaigns on both the Western and Eastern fronts, he will surely be missed by all Germans."

### The Kaiserbund ###

 gerdom.72.t:0 "Status of Indonesia"
 gerdom.72.d:0 "As part of our Kaiserbund programme we have decided to make our Indonesian holdings a semi-autonomous state in our empire. How would we like to divide the lands?"
 gerdom.72.a:0 "Create a pan-Malayan state."
 gerdom.72.b:0 "Divide the lands between Sarawak and Malaysia."

 gerdom.73.t:0 "Status of Indochina"
 gerdom.73.d:0 "As part of our Kaiserbund programme we have decided to make our Indochinese holdings a semi-autonomous state in our empire. How would we like to divide the lands?"
 gerdom.73.a:0 "Create a pan-Indochinese state."
 gerdom.73.b:0 "Divide it into states."

 gerdom.74.t:0 "The Division of Mittelafrika"
 gerdom.74.d:0 "As part of our new Kaiserbund policy it is incumbent on us to issue directions as new administrative arrangements in our colonies. One such territory is Mittelafrika. While conservative members of the Reichstag are eager to leave the autonomous state unmolested, the bulk of our political establishment has already realised that Freistaat of Mittelafrika acts as a burden for both the German armed forces and our economy. Among the limited benefits, the colony offers us is imperial prestige, and even then the Dark Continent is no longer seen in the same light as during Scramble for Afrika. Therefore, drastic reorganisation of this area is needed if we want to retain our presence in Afrika while limiting our costs as much as possible."
 gerdom.74.a:0 "Divide Mittelafrika into states."
 gerdom.74.b:0 "Federalise them."
 gerdom.74.c:0 "Keep the status quo."

 gerdom.75.t:0 "Status of Malta"
 gerdom.75.d:0 "With our new Kaiserbund policy currently being instituted by all limbs of the German state, the gaze of our officials has reached the Mediterranean island of Malta. Almost all important members of the general staff and many conservative politicians are arguing for keeping this island under direct control. They argue that Malta is crucial for the security of our Mediterranean shipping lanes between Marokko and the Suez, and point to its function as an 'unsinkable aircraft carrier'."
 gerdom.75.a:0 "Grant them limited autonomy."
 gerdom.75.b:0 "Keep them under our direct control."

 #gerdom.76.t:0 "Status of Somaliland"
 #gerdom.76.d:0 "With our decision to implement the Kaiserbund programme we still have to decide the extent of its implementation on various fringe regions under our control. One such region is the German Somaliland. While admirals of Kaiserliche Marine are arguing for keeping this territory under our direct control as a way to keep the Gulf of Aden under our control, most of our politicians would rather cut down our expenses with the administration of this territory even at cost of diminishing our presence in this area."

 gerdom.77.t:0 "The Reorganisation of Mittelafrika"
 gerdom.77.d:0 "We will have to reorganise our internal structure in accordance with the new orders from Germany..."
 gerdom.77.a:0 "A new order for Africa!"
 gerdom.77.b:0 "Oh, I don't think so."

 gerdom.78.t:0 "The Reorganisation of Mittelafrika"
 gerdom.78.d:0 "We will have to reorganise our internal structure in accordance with the new orders from Germany..."
 gerdom.78.a:0 "A new order for Africa!"
 gerdom.78.b:0 "Oh, I don't think so."

 gerdom.81.t:0 "Status of Aden"
 gerdom.81.d:0 "With our decision to implement the Kaiserbund programme we still have to decide the extent of its implementation in various fringe regions under our control. One such region is Aden in Yemen. While admirals of Kaiserliche Marine are arguing for keeping this territory under our direct control as a way to keep the Gulf of Aden under our control, most politicians would rather cut down on our administrative expenses even at the cost of diminishing our presence in the region."
 gerdom.81.a:0 "Grant them limited autonomy."
 gerdom.81.b:0 "Offer Aden to Yemen."
 gerdom.81.c:0 "Keep them under our direct control."

 gerdom.82.t:0 "Germany Offers Us Aden"
 gerdom.82.d:0 "The Germans have sent us an offer in which they will secede us the Aden and in return, we become their protectorate. The offer is tempting, to say the least, should we accept it?"
 gerdom.82.a:0 "Accept the offer!"
 gerdom.82.b:0 "We refuse!"

 gerdom.83.t:0 "Yemen Accepted"
 gerdom.83.d:0 "The Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen has agreed to our offer and they have become our protectorate."
 gerdom.83.a:0 "Great!"

 gerdom.84.t:0 "Coronation of Wilhelm III"
 gerdom.84.d:0 "With the passing of the great Weltkriegskaiser Wilhelm II, Wilhelm III has given a grand speech on his coronation day to guide all of Germany towards prosperity and to safeguard our interests across the globe!"
 gerdom.84.a:0 "Heil dir im Siegerkranz!"

 gerdom.85.t:0 "Germany Bans French Organisations!"
 gerdom.85.d:0 "In response to the increasing self-assurance and revolutionary spirit of the Commune, the pathetic German leadership has instituted a harsh policy of cracking down on any organisations funded by us or related to French culture or politics in any manner. These discriminatory actions aimed against the struggling French minority within Germany, particularly in our occupied regions of Lorraine and Alsace, are absolutely intolerable."
 gerdom.85.a:0 "This shall not stand. To war!"
 gerdom.85.b:0 "Assist French resistance groups."
 gerdom.85.c:0 "Publicly condemn German actions."
 gerdom.85.e:0 "We should avoid entanglements at this stage."

 gerdom.86.t:0 "International Condemnation of Our Ban!"
 gerdom.86.d:0 "The Commune of France used our recent actions aimed against all French organisations within the German Empire to organise an international conference on the issue. They publicly condemned what they call 'German Imperialism' and pledged to do everything possible to protect the French minority within the Reich. In response, several important members of the international community similarly condemned our actions against the French population, stating that such actions are a stain on the honour of a modern state. How should we react to this public humiliation?"
 gerdom.86.a:0 "The Communards are behind this, destroy them!"
 gerdom.86.b:0 "Germany cares not for the protests of minnows."
 gerdom.86.c:0 "Restore the rights of the French minority."

 gerdom.91.t:0 "German Mission Arrives In Don-Kuban"
 gerdom.91.d:0 "The German Empire decided to send an official military mission to our homeland in order to help us improve our obsolete armed forces. Such missions are well regarded for their impact on the militaries of nations like Ukraine and Venezuela, and we are fortunate to have them."
 gerdom.91.a:0 "We will show them Cossack hospitality!"

 gerdom.92.t:0 "Lettow-Vorbeck and the Flame of German Resistance"
 gerdom.92.d:0 "This is the darkest hour of the German Empire. Defeated by the planes, tanks and tactics of a brutal foe, the imperial government has evacuated Berlin and is currently converging, shell-shocked and battered, on Dar-es-Salaam. However, the army is not Germany itself, and under the African skies, our loyal colonies remain committed to the war effort. All the same, the Reich's government as it stands is facing loathing for presiding over the greatest military catastrophe in German history, and many senior army officers are demanding the appointment of a new emergency chancellor. Many of them are clamouring for Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck to be elevated to this position, given his successes in Afrika during the Weltkrieg and the loyalty and affection that he commands among the askaris we must now rely on."
 gerdom.92.a:0 "Yes! Appoint von Lettow-Vorbeck! Heia Safari!"
 gerdom.92.b:0 "No! This would be the last nail in the coffin of our democracy!"

 gerdom.93.t:0 "Lettow-Vorbeck Proposes an 'Afrikakorps'"
 gerdom.93.d:0 "Chancellor von Lettow-Vorbeck has stood before the emergency government and argued that the German state must raise additional units of native Schutztruppen, also known as askaris. These doughty soldiers have served the Reich faithfully ever since the chancellor outwitted the Entente in the jungles of Ostafrika during the Weltkrieg. Controversially, von Lettow-Vorbeck has also proposed that we grant the native kings, princes and vassals that rule Afrika in our stead complete independence once we retake our Vaterland. Such a reward would incentivise our native population and leaders and invigorate them to assist us in getting to Berlin. This is a desperate proposal, but the Reich is going through desperate times."
 gerdom.93.a:0 "Rally the askaris from all of Mittelafrika!"
 gerdom.93.b:0 "Pointless. We need German troops for a German war!"

 gerdom.94.t:0 "Afrikakorps in Südwestafrika"
 gerdom.94.d:0 "One of the first German colonies, Südwestafrika has proven especially loyal to the imperial government. However, its close connection with the founding of the German colonial empire might make it difficult for conservatives within our cabinet to accept the prospect of independence that has promised by von Lettow-Vorbeck."
 gerdom.94.a:0 "Excellent."

 gerdom.95.t:0 "Afrikakorps in Deutsch-Ostafrika"
 gerdom.95.d:0 "The site of some of the most impressive battles fought by the German colonial army under von Lettow-Vorbeck during the Weltkrieg, Ostafrika, with its capital of Dar-es-Salaam, is seen by most officials as the jewel in the crown of the Reich's African possessions. As such the German administration is deeply entrenched here and cooperation with the natives run smoothly, resulting in a large turnout of volunteers for the new Schutztruppen."

 gerdom.96.t:0 "Afrikakorps in Deutsch-Kongo"
 gerdom.96.d:0 "Taken from the defeated Belgian state after the Weltkrieg, the Congo occupies the heart of Central Africa and has for decades of German administration been heavily militarised to secure the Reich's control over the province."

 gerdom.97.t:0 "Afrikakorps in Äquatorialafrika"
 gerdom.97.d:0 "Strategically located to the immediate south of the Sahara, the colony of German Equatorial Africa employs some of the most impressive auxiliary troops, most of which have spent years fighting nomadic raiders on the border."

 gerdom.98.t:0 "Afrikakorps in Niger-Kamerun"
 gerdom.98.d:0 "One of the more recently acquired African provinces, Niger was merged with the German colony of Kamerun in the Mittelafrikan state. Though somewhat disunited, the natives stand ready to earn their independence in the pay of the Reich!"

 gerdom.99.t:0 "Afrikakorps in Togoland"
 gerdom.99.d:0 "Consisting of the original German colony of Togo and the annexed British and French colonies of the Gold Coast and Dahomey, the askaris formed here are of a notably lesser quality than seen elsewhere in Mittelafrika. All the same, they stand ready to assist Germany in its hour of need - for the right price."

 gerdom.100.t:0 "Decolonisation of Afrika"
 gerdom.100.d:0 "In the darkest hour of the German Empire, Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck rallied the colonial askaris behind the Reich by promising them independence once the war had been won. Our enemies have been crushed and Berlin liberated, leading to many of our African subjects humbly asking us to uphold our promises and commence the decolonisation of our domains in Africa."
 gerdom.100.a:0 "We shall uphold our promises."
 gerdom.100.b:0 "Afrika shall remain German forevermore!"

### Security ###

 gerdom.105.t:0 "Germany Suppresses its French Population!"
 gerdom.105.d:0 "The German Empire, afraid of the rising power of our state, decided to tighten control of the border regions since they are fearful of our growing influence! We must be patient, soon the time will come when our brothers in Wallonia, Lorraine and Alsace shall be liberated!"
 gerdom.105.a:0 "Soon, our time shall come!"

 gerdom.106.t:0 "Further Internal Security Measures"
 gerdom.106.d:0 "Despite the gradual increase of military and police presence in our border region, it is still not enough. Underground French Syndicalist leaders are still on loose, poisoning the minds of our French minority with propaganda, with many using existing French organisations as cover for their vile acts. In order to fully secure our territorial integrity, right-wing members of our government have demanded the complete dissolution of all French or French funded organisations. However, even if such drastic step may seem necessary, it will undoubtedly damage our reputation in the international community..."
 gerdom.106.a:0 "Current security measures are sufficient!"
 gerdom.106.b:0 "It's time to ban all French organisations in Germany!"
 gerdom.106.c:0 "This plan was madness from the beginning, abandon it..."

### Rhenish Syndicalist Volunteers ###

 gerdom.200.t:0 "Bertolt Brecht Requests Visa"
 gerdom.200.d:0 "For some time now, Syndicalist sympathisers from the Rhineland have been going abroad to help their 'comrades' in their various conflicts around the world. Today, the famous underground writer Bertolt Brecht has announced his intent to join these 'International Divisions'.\n\nWe could let him go, which would most likely inspire quite a number of other Syndicalists to go abroad after him, or we could confiscate his passport and prohibit him from leaving the country. As Brecht is a prominent figure, blocking him could perhaps weaken the Syndicalist cause, but on the other hand, it would likely cause tremendous outrage..."
 gerdom.200.aa:0 "Let him go to wild America."
 gerdom.200.ab:0 "He can go to Brazil if he wants."
 gerdom.200.ac:0 "He can go to Brazil if he wants."
 gerdom.200.ad:0 "Let's hope he freezes in Russia."
 gerdom.200.ae:0 "He can sweat in Spain."
 gerdom.200.af:0 "We should keep him where we can watch him."

 gerdom.201.t:0 "German Volunteers Arrive in America"
 gerdom.201.d:0 "Two German volunteer divisions, headed by the writer Bertolt Brecht and other figures of the German Syndicalist scene, have arrived to support us in our struggle!"

 gerdom.204.a:0 "Die Internationale erkämpft das Menschenrecht!"

 gerdom.205.t:0 "Calm in the Rhineland"
 gerdom.205.d:0 "With a number of prominent Syndicalists out of the country and allowed to fight, and hopefully die, in foreign lands, tensions in our lands have decreased greatly without their malign influence. The Rhineland is finally seeing some peace and quiet."
 gerdom.205.a:0 "Let's hope things stay this way."

 gerdom.206.t:0 "Policy on Returning Syndicalists"
 gerdom.206.d:0 "Now that their war has been lost, the 'International Divisions' formed from our volunteers are trying to return to their homes. Many still have their arms and all survivors are battle-hardened, indoctrinated Syndicalists. However, if we prohibit them from entering over our borders, we should be able to keep them away without much of a scandal due to the hardening of the German population's views on the Red Menace. Still, we might risk them turning against us when we inevitably come to blows with the Internationale."
 gerdom.206.a:0 "They'll have to serve their term in the Heer!"
 gerdom.206.b:0 "Let them return to their families."
 gerdom.206.c:0 "Close the borders!"

 gerdom.207.t:0 "Bertolt Brecht Dies in Suspicious Circumstances"
 gerdom.207.d:0 "Though rumours have been spreading for weeks, we now have official confirmation; Syndicalist writer Bertolt Brecht has died in some rotten cellar, most likely at the hands of foreign police. After serving abroad as a Syndicalist volunteer, Brecht was blocked from re-entering Germany.\n\nHis family, together with other Syndicalist elements, staged scale demonstrations in Berlin, blaming our hardline policy towards Syndicalist volunteers for his death."
 gerdom.207.a:0 "It seems that we have created a martyr."

 gerdom.208.t:0 "Bertolt Brecht Returns to Germany"
 gerdom.208.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, it seems like the Syndicalist writer Bertolt Brecht has somehow managed to smuggle himself over the border. He and his family have gone underground and the controversial figure is openly preaching for solidarity by the workers against the capitalist system."
 gerdom.208.a:0 "Can't he ever shut up?!"

 gerdom.209.t:0 "International Divisions Offer Their Service"
 gerdom.209.d:0 "After valiantly fighting for the Syndicalist cause, the comrades and veterans of the International Divisions have cowardly been denied entrance to their own homeland in Germany. After months of drifting, many of the former members have now reassembled and decided to take up arms to liberate Germany from the scourge of imperialism. While their numbers have been reduced by fighting and poverty, they are battle-hardened veterans and would make a worthy addition to the forces of the Internationale."
 gerdom.209.a:0 "Welcome comrades!"
 gerdom.209.b:0 "A needless expense."

### Foreign Events ###

 gerfor.1.t:0 "Union of Britain Attacks Denmark"
 gerfor.1.d:0 "The Union of Britain has declared war on Denmark. This invasion threatens to disrupt the balance of power in favour of the Internationale, and the Danish government has asked for our help. Shall we warn the Syndicalists about the foolishness of their actions or say nothing, and risk losing Denmark?"
 gerfor.1.a:0 "Warn them to turn back or face German arms!"
 gerfor.1.b:0 "We have enough problems to be dealing with."

 gerfor.2.t:0 "Germany Sends an Ultimatum over Denmark"
 gerfor.2.d:0 "The Second Reich has sent an ultimatum to London. We are to either make peace with Denmark and declare a ceasefire or Germany will come to Denmark's aid. Though it is certainly in our interests to seize the Skagerrak and pose a dangerous threat to Germany on its northern border, calling their bluff may prove to be extremely risky."
 gerfor.2.a:0 "We will not risk war with Germany over this."
 gerfor.2.b:0 "We do not negotiate with imperialists."

 gerfor.3.t:0 "German Assistance Against Britain"
 gerfor.3.d:0 "We are in a state of war with the Union of Britain. Our military, while proud, will not be able to withstand the Syndicalist onslaught. Some influential figures are petitioning us to ask the Germans for help, even if it might mean having to accept some German influence after the invasion is repelled. What shall we do?"
 gerfor.3.a:0 "Thank you Berlin!"
 gerfor.3.b:0 "The Germans cannot be trusted."

 gerfor.4.t:0 "Union of Britain Backs Down"
 gerfor.4.d:0 "After the ultimatum was received by London they quickly sent orders to all of their commanders on the ground to cease fire and return to the British Isles. We have achieved a diplomatic victory today. We have shown the world that we will stand up to Socialist and Syndicalist aggression. We will protect any nation under threat from Britain or the Commune."
 gerfor.4.a:0 "Yet again German diplomacy wins the day."

 gerfor.5.t:0 "Britain Ignores Our Denmark Ultimatum"
 gerfor.5.d:0 "Despite the ultimatum being received by London their forces continue their move towards Danish territory, demonstrably ignoring our simple demands. We can either declare war and bring Denmark into our alliance or we can stand down and let Denmark fall, creating a northern front with our Syndicalist foe."
 gerfor.5.a:0 "They have made their choice, war it is!"
 gerfor.5.b:0 "Back down. There will be peace in our time."

 gerfor.6.t:0 "Britain Backs Down Over Denmark"
 gerfor.6.d:0 "After the ultimatum was received by London they quickly sent orders to all of their commanders ordering an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal to British territory. Denmark's independence has been preserved and our pride left intact. All the same, the fact that it took German intervention to protect us is somewhat unsettling."
 gerfor.6.a:0 "We couldn't have done it without them."

 gerfor.7.t:0 "Internationale Seeks to Reunify Italy"
 gerfor.7.d:0 "The combined forces of the French Commune and the Socialist Republic of Italy have launched an attempt to seize the entirety of Italy. This invasion threatens to disrupt the balance of power in Europe in favour of the Syndicalists. Shall we warn the Internationale that this threatens world peace or let the peninsula fall to their malignant ideology?"

 gerfor.8.t:0 "Germany Sends an Ultimatum over Italy"
 gerfor.8.d:0 "The German Empire has sent us a telegram, demanding that either we end our intervention in Italy and declare a ceasefire with the Italian states or the Reich will intervene by force."

 gerfor.9.t:0 "Germany Sends the Internationale an Ultimatum"
 gerfor.9.d:0 "The Kaiserreich has come to our aid! They have sent an ultimatum to the Commune of France over their support for the Socialist Republic of Italy in its attempts to conquer the entire peninsula. The Germans demand that the Syndicalists fall back or risk utter annihilation."

 gerfor.10.t:0 "Commune of France Withdraws from Italy"
 gerfor.10.d:0 "After the ultimatum was received by Paris, they quickly withdrew their forces from the frontlines and abandoned the peninsula. Our independence will be preserved, and our pride left intact."
 gerfor.10.d.sri:0 "Drawing [FRA.GetNameDef] into our war with [ITA.GetNameDef] was perhaps not the wisest idea. The war drew the attention of the Reich which issued an ultimatum to [FRA.GetNameDef] to cease the invasion. The [FRA.GetAdjective] government has complied, ordering our forces to stand down. We have little choice but to comply."

 gerfor.12.d:0 "Our ultimatum was flatly ignored. Already SRI and Communard forces are on the march in Italy and refusing to return to their pre-war boundaries. The other states of the Italian peninsula are threatened existentially and Syndicalism is poised to spread its vile ideology to every corner of the land. The issue now is, do we back up our ultimatum with force and declare war on the Internationale?"

 gerfor.14.t:0 "Germany Sends an Ultimatum over Spain"
 gerfor.14.d:0 "Monarchies are as thick as thieves. After we began our campaign against the Spanish kingdom we received a message from Berlin ordering us to cease and desist in our military efforts. They claim that if we do not bring our forces back beyond the Pyrenees they will intervene militarily to preserve the current status quo."

 gerfor.16.t:0 "Commune of France Backs Down in Spain"
 gerfor.16.d:0 "The Germans have achieved a significant diplomatic coup today, and helped preserve our independence. After the Reich sent an ultimatum to the Commune of France ordering them to cease their military aggression towards us, the French wisely decided to comply and brought their troops back from beyond the Pyrenees. The status quo remains, for now at least, intact."

 gerfor.17.t:0 "Commune of France Ignores Spanish Ultimatum"
 gerfor.17.d:0 "Despite our public condemnation of the Communard invasion of the Spanish Kingdom and subsequent ultimatum, the French have refused to pull their forces back. The possibility of the loss of yet another European monarchy can no longer be discounted, and the choice is now incumbent on us to decide how we should respond to this flagrant dismissal of German hegemony."

 gerfor.24.d:0 "The Russians have reached the Oder. There has been little outright panicking in Berlin but it is clear that without a counter-attack Germany is greatly endangered.

 gerfor.25.d:0 "The French have reached the Rhine. Our substantial border fortifications were seemingly unable to stop their inexorable advance and now our crucial industrial cities are falling one after another. The situation is quite dire, and already there are treasonous murmurings that the Communards could reach Berlin itself."

 gerfor.27.t:0 "Germany Occupies Spanish Morocco!"
 gerfor.27.d:0 "The German Empire, in a show of absolute arrogance and disrespect towards our state, has occupied Spanish Morocco. Shockingly, their forces have even moved into Ceuta and Melilla, two cities that have been an inviolable Spanish territory for many centuries."

 gerfor.28.d:0 "The island of Madagascar has been under our rule for several decades and it is an untapped source of rare timbers like ebony and several varieties of rosewood. As these sources have not been exploited, several industrialists and members of the colonial government have proposed that we establish a joint-stock company with authority over the timber industry on the island. Shall we decree the establishment of such a company?"

 gerfor.29.d:0 "The joint-stock company that we established has begun to show some results and our inventory of rare timber has steadily increased. However, with the mechanisation of logging, several thousand locals have been put out of work. The company has at the same time advised that we begin construction on a new timber processing plant to streamline production. If we were to fund this new project it would kill two birds with one stone, so to speak."

 gerfor.30.t:0 "New Madagascan Processing Complex"
 gerfor.30.d:0 "The new timber processing complex has opened and the transformative effects on the local economy were immediate. Many workers responsible for the initial construction were retained by the company and many new workers were needed after construction was complete, dramatically increasing employment in the area. The access to rare timbers has also increased and a gala was held in Tananarive to toast the new complex's opening."
 gerfor.30.a:0 "A successful colonial endeavour."

 gerfor.31.t:0 "Uprising on Madagascar"

Unfortunately, Republican resistance has proven stronger than we previously anticipated, and attempts to launch a full-scale naval invasion have soured. We can now either continue the armed struggle or try to end this futile conflict by way of a peace treaty."

 gerfor.33.t:0 "Germany Proposes a Second Peace With Honour"
 gerfor.33.d:0 "Attempts from the Reichspakt to gain a foothold on our island and decisively end the war have failed miserably. Though the collapse of the Commune was a terrible blow to the Revolutionary cause, British arms have proven to be too much for Jerry to handle. Now the leadership of the German Empire is offering us a proposal - to terminate conflict between the Reichspakt and the remaining members of Internationale in exchange for mutual recognition. How shall we react?"

 gerfor.34.d:0 "It is finally done. Though we had hoped for the total obliteration of the Union of Britain and the end to Syndicalist influence in Europe, alas it was not to be. Instead the British wisely decided to make terms with us, signing the treaty with a view of a full German military parade. With this, the bulk of the fighting is now over, and the Second Weltkrieg virtually ended in Europe."
 gerfor.34.a:0 "Peace at last!"

 gerfor.35.t:0 "The British Refused Peace!"
 gerfor.35.d:0 "In a staggering display of British stubbornness, the Syndicalist wretches flatly denied our calls for a peace treaty. Instead of swallowing their pride and accepting the inevitable, the Republican government stated that they would not have a Second Peace With Honour, and would end the war by marching through Berlin."

 gerfor.37.t:0 "Union of Britain Invades Norway"
 gerfor.37.d:0 "The Union of Britain has made the bold move of declaring war on the Norwegians, seeking to impose Syndicalism on them by force of arms. This invasion shows scant regard for German supremacy in Europe and the status quo that we have spent years maintaining. The question now is, what should our response to be this act of barbarism by the British?"

 gerfor.38.t:0 "Germany Sends an Ultimatum over Norway"
 gerfor.38.d:0 "We have received a damning telegram from the Reich. They are demanding that either we cease our invasion of Norway or face the full might of the Kaiserliche Marine. They cite the inviolability of sovereign European nations and a whole lot of guff about guarding the balance, but everyone knows that this act stems from Germany’s desperate attempts to hold onto their hegemonic status on the continent. What should our response be?"

 gerfor.39.t:0 "Germany Warns the Union of Britain over Norway"

 gerfor.40.t:0 "The Union of Britain Backs Down"
 gerfor.40.d:0 "After the ultimatum was received by London they quickly sent orders to all of their commanders on the ground to cease fire and return to the coast. We have achieved a diplomatic victory today, we have shown the world we will stand up to Socialist and Syndicalist aggression. We will protect any nation under threat from Britain or France."

 gerfor.41.t:0 "Britain Ignores our Norwegian Ultimatum"
 gerfor.41.d:0 "In a display of repugnant audacity, the Union of Britain ignored our ultimatum. North Sea operations do not seem to have altered at all and the Republicans are continuing the war against Norway. We cannot risk the red tide of Syndicalism sinking its tendrils into yet another nation, particularly one important to our strategic interests. At the same time, open war with London would distract us at an inopportune time and potentially lead to the Internationale joining in."

 gerfor.42.t:0 "The British Withdraw from Norway"
 gerfor.42.d:0 "The Union of Britain appears to have listened to wise counsel and ceased their operations in the North Sea. The German ultimatum appears to have scared them off, and Syndicalism stopped from claiming yet another scalp."

 gerfor.43.t:0 "Treaty with Ireland"
 gerfor.43.d:0 "With the Syndicalists awakening all over the world it is crucial for the Reichspakt to help potential allies whenever possible. With Irish sympathies swayed towards Germany due to our support during the War of Independence there now exists the possibility of gaining a strong foothold just under the socialists' noses by getting Ireland into the Reichspakt. We should start by offering them equipment and construction support."

Conservative elements in the country say that it is our sacred duty to defend Europe against the godless Reds while others say that we should not fight Germany's war for them. After all, Germany treated us rather shabbily when it came to the Brest-Litovsk divisions, with Poland and Ukraine being forced from our sphere of influence by the glory-hogging Reich.

Although the people are exhausted from years of war, there still remains a strong pro-German sentiment amongst the ruling class and a desire to stand side by side with the victors of the new order.\n\nNonetheless our empire does not intend to sell its skin cheaply and has demanded that the Caucasus, traditionally part of the Ottoman sphere, be restored to its control and that Azerbaijan becomes more tightly connected to the Sublime Porte.

 gerfor.126.t:0 "Germany Threatens War!"
 gerfor.126.d:0 "Due to our recent refusal of the German deal at the Baku Conference, it seems the German government has threatened us with war if we do not accept their demands. The choice seems clear here, as war with the Kaiserreich would almost certainly mean the end."

 gerfor.127.t:0 "Azerbaijan Still Refuses!"

 gerfor.128.d:0 "Germany's demands were a bit more radical than expected, with them not only demanding oil but also for us to embargo Russia in order to cut off their oil supplies. While our independence will still be guaranteed, Russia will bear much more resentment towards us. In the long run, this could pose a serious risk to our nation."
 gerfor.128.a:0 "We'll accept."
 gerfor.128.b:0 "We can't embargo Russia, but the oil is fine."
 gerfor.128.c:0 "This was a bad idea."

 gerfor.129.t:0 "Azerbaijan Accepts the Oil Treaty"
 gerfor.129.d:0 "Azerbaijan has accepted the entirety of our deal, which promises to starve the Russians of oil and provide us with it. Not only have we strengthened ourselves greatly, but we have also managed to successfully cripple an enemy in the process."

 gerfor.130.t:0 "Azerbaijan Changes the Deal"
 gerfor.130.d:0 "Azerbaijan has changed the treaty to a much more mild approach, removing the Russian embargo clause so that we only get oil from them. In a negotiation, one must always make compromises, but the power disparity between us and the Azeris is massive. Should we accept the clause variation?"
 gerfor.130.a:0 "We'll concede on the embargo point."
 gerfor.130.b:0 "Take it or leave it."

 gerfor.131.t:0 "Germany Refuses to Give Concessions"
 gerfor.131.d:0 "Germany has refused our tamer approach at the conference, and stated that the deal will be off if we do not both guarantee oil supplies and embargo the Russians. It seems we can't make them budge on this point, so acceptance may be our only option. The alternative could be catastrophic."
 gerfor.131.a:0 "Fine then."

 gerfor.132.t:0 "Azerbaijan Refuses Again"

 gerfor.133.t:0 "Germany Threatens War!"
 gerfor.133.d:0 "Germany, fed up with us refusing not once, but twice, has threatened us with war if their side of the deal is not met.

 gerfor.134.d:0 "The German diplomats have claimed in the conference that the Azeri government and industrial sector is not equipped to properly exploit the oil deposits in the country. They have recommended allowing them to have complete oversight of our industries by placing German directors into key positions in state-owned oil companies, meaning that together we can access even more oil. While we could all get rich off the deal, the problem is that this could possibly threaten our position as an independent nation."
 gerfor.134.a:0 "Well alright then..."
 gerfor.134.b:0 "Economic influence is enough, we shall have no directors."
 gerfor.134.c:0 "Refuse outright."

 gerfor.135.a:0 "Let the black gold flow."

 gerfor.136.t:0 "Azerbaijan Varies the Treaty"
 gerfor.136.d:0 "Azerbaijan has vetoed the idea of us having our directors manage their oil companies, and they only wish to have economic guidance. Our influence over the country and its oil supplies would still be immense, though substantially less than with our German oversight of the oil industry itself."
 gerfor.136.a:0 "We'll accept the change."
 gerfor.136.b:0 "It's this or nothing!"

 gerfor.137.t:0 "Germany Accepts the Modified Treaty"
 gerfor.137.d:0 "Germany has accepted our version of the treaty, which help us get more out of our oil fields and whilst also gaining us a guarantee from the Reich. In exchange, all we need do is ensure that the oil supply remains unmolested and that the shipments reach Germany."
 gerfor.137.a:0 "Great!"

 gerfor.138.t:0 "Germany Reaffirms the Original Proposal"
 gerfor.138.d:0 "The Reich's diplomats have seemingly not budged on their position on having German directors control our oil fields, and this is simply unacceptable for us as it essentially makes us a puppet of Germany. Unfortunately, the threat of war is present if we refuse. How do we respond?"
 gerfor.138.a:0 "It's this or war."
 gerfor.138.b:0 "Maybe the Russians will help?"
 gerfor.138.c:0 "We said no the first time, we'll say it again."

 gerfor.139.t:0 "Azerbaijan Requests Assistance"
 gerfor.139.d:0 "Ever since the collapse of the Baku Conference between Germany and Azerbaijan over the oil supply, tensions have been heating up. Germany has now formally threatened them with war. Azeri diplomats have sent a telegram asking for our assistance in the matter, and a reward of oil might be in it for us if we help. The question is, should we pressure Germany to back down?"

As a result of a recent policy change in Berlin, their current priority is solidifying their control over the Mediterranean. Already in control of the Suez, they are now demanding that we hand the Rock over to them."
 gerfor.143.a:0 "Well, do we even have a choice?"

 gerfor.157.d:0 "Apparently, at the instigation of the Azeri government, Russia has gotten involved in the Baku oil dispute and threatened to go to war with us if we enter Azerbaijan's borders. A war with the Russians would be bloody and, while valuable, the Baku oil fields are probably not worth losing a million German men over."

Now their wishes have finally come true, as a state of war now exists between our glorious Vaterland and the nest of vipers to our west. Kaiser Wilhelm II explained the reasons for Germany's involvement in another war with France in a special radio address, and called for the eradication of the final obstacle to achieving "A Place in the Sun". Subsequently, thousands of young Germans rushed to enlist in the military, following the example of the Kaiser's grandsons, and civilians began gathering on the streets publicly displaying their support for the war.

The paper reported that two daughters of Freiherr Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord, a leading general and friend of influential Reichskriegsminister von Schleicher, were involved in shady dealings with Syndicalist-aligned intelligence agencies. Shortly afterwards, the Reichstag member Franz Seldte fanned the flames by asking why the Abwehr, run by von Schleicher's friend Ferdinand von Bredow, was not able to find out that the family of an associate of the War Secretary was infiltrated by hostile intelligence. While General von Hammerstein-Equord resigned and publicly apologised for his daughters' doings, the real question for von Schleicher is - should he pull strings to replace von Bredow and remove any further threats to his political career from that direction, and if yes - replace him with whom?"

On the other hand, most Germans haven't forgotten the ensuing military dictatorship that only ended when Admiral Von Tirpitz forced him to retire after the infamous Osthilfeskandal in 1924.

 germit.1.t:0 "Germany Proposes a Single Currency"
 germit.1.d.independent:0 "In light of the consequences of Black Monday, the German government has come up with a new proposal to rejuvenate the continental economy. In order to meaningfully increase and simplify commerce and trade across the Reichspakt, they propose that the German currency, the Mark, should become the accepted currency in all Mitteleuropa, renamed formally to the 'Europamark'. This proposal is modelled somewhat after the Zollverein agreements between German states in the 19th century, which, among other things, established a standardised system of currency exchange pegged to the Prussian mark - although its reach and ambition are far greater.\n\nIn many of Germany's 'subject partner' states, the currencies are tied to the Mark already, so the actual impact would be relatively minimal. How should we respond to this proposal?"

 germit.11.t:0 "Europakommission Membership"
 germit.11.d:0 "Though Mitteleuropa nations share a common currency in the form of the Europamark, to be a proper part of the bloc now, a nation must put itself under the jurisdiction of the Europakommission. This body regulates industrial production and quality across the continent, though clearly is biased in favour of the German Empire."
