### Leaders ###

 POLITICS_GBP_HUGH_GAITSKELL_DESC:0 "Taking education at Oxford in 1924, he'd see the first drops of the revolution and unlike many of his student peers, support the general strike. When revolution broke out, Gaitskell was quick to support it and witnessed first-hand the political suppression of the workers movement by the conservative government. Despite his support for the revolution, brutal crackdowns against 'reactionary agitators' would soon cause him to fall in with more moderate types and become a firm supporter of the resurrected fabian Labour Party. A stint in prison for counter-revolutionary activities would further cause his jump to the right, with Gaitskell being one of the most moderate figures within the party before its dissolution. Now with the Union dead, Gaitskell has managed reorganise the old Labour party under the most moderate elements in the hopes of creating a painless transition from syndicalism to a democratic and free society."
 POLITICS_GBP_HERBERT_SAMUEL_DESC:0 "One of the many Liberals to support the revolution against the tyranny of the Conservative government. With the party split, Samuel took up the reigns of its leadership and ushered it into the new regime, having a friendly rivalry with Clement Atlee's Labour Party. During the early 1930s, Samuel undercame immense suspicion and was eventually arrested for counter-revolutionary activities, being one of the most notable political prisoners of the Union. Now having been able to wrangle support to lead the post-Union order, Samuel will no doubt seek a more fast-paced and shock-therapy like measures of desyndicalising the Union while maintaining some of the social safety nets he had helped establish."
 POLITICS_GBP_ANTHONY_LUDOVICI_DESC:0 "Polyglot and far-right author, Anthony Ludovici had a tumultuous run in the Union, often forced to flee for counter-revolutionary activities and his notable reactionary underground works. During his times of exile and underground politicking, Ludovici interacted with similarly minded far-right figures and ex-conservatives, all prepared to work with foreign invaders to see the downfall of the Union. Now in power, Ludovici and his supporters will no doubt pursue a ruthless campaign of 'purifying' Britain of its fallen socialist masters and suppressing dissent by any means necessary."
 POLITICS_GBP_CHARLES_III_DESC:0 "The so-called 'traitor prince' for his defection to Germany during the Weltkrieg, Charles Edward of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha ultimately picked the right side but was devastated to see his home country fall to syndicalism, driving him even further into the arms of reactionary German forces. Loyalty to Germany was enough to propel him to be king of Germany's own UK; a distorted version with Charles a semi-absolute monarch in the Prussian style, lording over a cabal of pro-German figures in the Privy Council. For Charles, his reign will no doubt be loathed and he will be remembered as the Traitor King and a stooge to Britain's nemesis."
