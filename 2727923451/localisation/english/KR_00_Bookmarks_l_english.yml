 KR_SCENARIO_NAME:0 "Legacy of the Weltkrieg"
 KR_SCENARIO_DESC:0 "As 1936 dawns, the Weltkrieg's legacy lies heavy upon the shoulders of a new generation. Germany stands astride the centre of the world, a power without peer, but about its feet lie enemies both old and new; from France's rising syndicalist Internationale, to the old Entente, to an unbroken Russia and an unrepentant rising sun. All the while Germany's vast reach has left it dangerously overstretched, its allies in Constantinople and Vienna have grown estranged, and across the Atlantic, the American colossus falters. Seventeen years have passed since the end of the war, and few expect the new year to bring a turning point, but soon a single spark may be all it takes to light the powder keg anew..."

### Majors ###

### Germany ###
 GER_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In 1919, after five years of war and with the Entente nearing a collapse, the German Empire saw its victory made manifest in the Treaty of Versailles. The Weltkrieg made Germany an uncontested World Power, yet things have been going downhill for her since the 1930s. A recessive world economy has dampened the nation's industrial output while other nations' manufacturing power recovers, and now nationalism grows in Germany's eastern client states, which are starting to drift away from the Reich. In 1936, Germany stands at a crossroads, and already we can see cracks in her mighty empire, as her ancestral enemies are regaining their former strength..."

### Commune of France ###
 FRA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Third Republic fell in the way it came to be: defeated by German arms and facing Revolution at home. In 1919, a General Strike was called by the CGT, causing the downfall of the bourgeois government. For 15 years, the new "Commune of France" has united behind a common platform of Syndico-Socialist consensus, headed by the Comité de Salut Public. However, by 1936 the need to rebuild the country and defend the revolution is believed to be outdated by many critics and there is a growing call for more radical policies. France is confident in her mission, but it is unclear which revolutionary strands shall become dominant in the years to come..."

### Union of Britain ###
 ENG_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After 1919's 'Peace with Honour' ended the Weltkrieg, the faith and support of the people in the Home Islands had disappeared. In 1925, disaster struck: a minor labour dispute quickly escalated into a General Strike called by the TUC, followed by military desertions to the strikers. After six weeks of rioting on a massive scale, the Royal Family and most of the country's elites were evacuated to Canada and instead, a new Congress of Trade Unions assumed political authority. The British people have built up socialism on their island and stood by their gallant allies in Europe but storms brew on the horizon and soon the nascent Union will be put to the ultimate test..."

### Canada ###
 CAN_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the Revolution of 1925, the Royal Family and other British exiles found refuge in Canada. With the support of the Conservatives, they established a semi-official government in exile, in hopes of one day reclaiming the Home Islands. All is not well, however. Canadians are growing weary of the British presence, and in 1931 the Conservative government fell to Mackenzie King's Liberals - who now hold a slim majority and see to assert greater Canadian sovereignty in the face of mounting pressure to prepare for the inevitable confrontation between the Entente and the Third Internationale."

### Russia ###
 RUS_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "During Russia's Civil War, the White forces fought with all they had, but the Red Army still dominated the country's industrial heartland. The German Empire, however, fearing a red Russia, decided to intervene on behalf of the Whites. Two years later, Moscow and Petrograd fell to the White forces, and a new Russian Republic was established. For the past fifteen years, the leading parties, S-R and Kadets, have governed in an uneasy coalition under Kerenskiy, but Russia is becoming increasingly unstable. Other political forces are growing, and they are considering that it is now time for change, so that the country may reassert her power in the world..."

### United States ###
 USA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The USA almost left their policy of isolation to intervene in the Weltkrieg, but ultimately kept out of the war. This led to a victory of the Central Powers. Since then, the USA has struggled economically, European trade opportunities, and the repayment of their loans to the Entente has been made impossible by a German victory. Still internationally regarded as a 'nobody', she now faces mounting internal dissent as the Republican-Democratic hegemony is challenged by two groups - the Syndicalists and the America First Party. With a mounting crisis at home and only a modest reputation overseas, things aren't looking good for the United States of America..."

### Japan ###
 JAP_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "While the 'Peace with Honour' guaranteed Japanese rule over the colonies, not all was well in the Empire of the Rising Sun. After a period of economic upheaval culminated in a syndicalist attempt on the life of Prince-Regent Hirohito in 1926, unstable governments followed one another in a year of crisis; First General Tanaka, then the democratic Coalition Cabinet and an intervention in north-east China. In 1936, Japan is poised to extend her empire. With Germany's dominance appearing to be in decline, the Japanese look hungrily at the remaining Qing territories and the German Pacific possessions..."

### Other ###
 OTHER_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are waiting for their turn to rise as a major player of this world. From major powers trying to keep their empires to the many nations trying to regain what they lost in the Weltkrieg, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world..."

### Featured ###

### Serbia ###
 SER_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In the other famed revolution of 1925, the Serbian people finally overthrew their monarchy and established the Serbian Republic, a bright light of liberty and democracy in the Balkans. For the past ten years, the Republic has languished under the restrictions of the Treaty of Wartholz, but the first sign of Austrian weakness will surely see those shackles tossed away. Can the Serbs regain what they lost in the Weltkrieg and light the torch of Yugoslavism again - all while keeping the freedom they finally achieved?"

### Bulgaria ###
 BUL_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The "Prussia of the Balkans" won its final battle in 1919 - Tsar Ferdinand's gambit proved successful and Greater Bulgaria was united for good. The past twenty years have not been kind to Bulgaria, however - shaken by crisis and ethnic strife, it is unprepared for the next inevitable war, and hope for democracy is rapidly fading. A new Liberal Concentration has formed, chaired by Prime Minister Petko Stainov, and they have one last chance to defend the Constitution of Tarnovo - or let it shrivel in darkness."

### Haiti ###
 HAI_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Four years after the official end of the American occupation, Haiti rests on a precipice. General D.P. Calixte seized the presidency in a bloodless coup from corrupt American puppet Louis Borno just two years ago. Claiming to govern in the name of the working class black populace, the mixed-race elite has rallied behind Elie Lescot, who leads a broad coalition in opposition to Calixte. Will President Calixte lead Haiti into a new era of equality and prosperity? Or will Haiti be in perpetual darkness..."

### Past Nations ###
####################

### Lithuania ###
 #LIT_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Lithuania was founded after the Weltkrieg as a monarchy closely tied to the German Empire - its vast non-Lithuanian population and ceaseless nationalist resentment marking its history up to today. The old king, Mindaugas II, passed a long time ago, and his heir is widely seen as a step backwards, lacking both the character and the skill to rule. While nefarious forces plot in the open and in the shadows alike, can the Kingdom survive the challenges ahead, however impossible they may seem?"

### White Ruthenia ###
 #WHR_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "White Ruthenia, formally the Belarusian People's Republic, has been under German influence from its birth on March 25, 1918. Thanks to the distance from Berlin, it was mostly left to its own devices, and the Belarusian Social-Democratic Party became the dominant political party, continuing the young republic's pro-German orientation. Nevertheless, the BSDP remains divided between moderates and radicals, and the army is deeply suspicious of the latter's influence. Time will tell whether one or the other upset the fragile status quo."

### United Baltic Duchy ###
 #BAT_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Baltic German nobility got what it wanted from the Weltkrieg - a restoration of the rights and privileges which Russification policies trampled over and a state they could call their own, the United Baltic Duchy. Here, under the reign of Duke Adolf Friedrich, the Four Baltic Knighthoods rule a decentralised monarchy, the sentinel of aristocratic tradition. But pressure mounts to reform this byzantine system, and the Duke has pushed through a liberal, reformist government to see the changes through. When everything is against them, however, can the Baltic German dream survive?"

### Kingdom of Bhutan ###
 #BHU_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "It has been just under thirty years since the petty lords of Bhutan were brought to heel under the benevolent rule of the first Bhutanese king, Ugyen Wangchuck. Since his death in 1926, the kingdom has nearly been torn apart by rival claimants and the loss of its British patrons, dashing away any opportunity for real reform and leaving Bhutan as a remote and backwards remnant of the feudal past. In recent years, however, the young King Jigme and his reform-minded allies in the royal court have begun the process of dragging the nation into the 20th century. Will these reformists be successful, or will a new force take form in the Himalayas?"

### Georgia ###
 #GEO_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the Russian civil war in full swing, the Menshevik stronghold in Georgia was able to slip away, first as part of the Transcaucasian Federation, then as the Democratic Republic of Georgia. Following a string of agreements with Germany and the Ottoman Empire, Georgia was safe, and under the charismatic leadership of Noe Zhordania, decades of peace and relative stability was achieved. However, Zhordania grows old, and is planning on retiring. With tensions rising across the Middle East, the peace he's brought may go with him..."

### South Africa ###
 #SAF_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Some would say South Africa is the place where the British Empire's decline became visible to the world: the trouble they had pacifying the insurgent Boers laying bare the rot which would later cost them the Weltkrieg. Britain eventually did prevail against them, and from the ashes arose the Union of South Africa in 1910, a British Dominion. Since then, the Empire collapsed, and now South Africa, in its new role as the last vanguard of British influence on the African continent, is on a crossroad: is its dominion status beneficial as prime minister Jan Smuts asserts? Or has the time come for South Africa to seize its destiny for itself?"

### Jabal Shammar ###
 #JBS_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Once rulers of Arabia, the Rashidi dynasty has come a long way since its peak in the late 19th century. A resurgent Ibn Saud and questionable loyalties amongst their allies have put the Emirate of Ha'il on the back foot, forced to ever more increase its reliance on the Ottoman Turks. To make matters worse, the dynasty is plagued by scheming and intrigue with various ambitious princes eyeing Saud's throne all for themselves..."

### Ottoman Empire ###
 #OTT_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Although the Ottoman Empire finished the Weltkrieg as a victor, the once-unstoppable empire has lost much of its former glory. The ever increasing rate at which it lost its far-flung possessions has been decisively halted but at what cost? Even after its beating, the Ottoman Empire still stands however and the reformist spirit, initiated in the 19th century, has only increased in vigour. Still, sharp disagreements rule the Chamber of Deputies as the centralist OHF under powerful orator and war hero Mustafa Kemal Pasha takes up the fight against the liberal coalition in a battle to decide the future of the entire Middle East..."

### Cyrenaica ###
 #LBA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When Muhammad ibn Ali al-Sanusi founded the Order in 1837, the armies of Christianity were bearing down on the last Muslim states of Africa, Central Asia and the Middle East. In a desperate attempt to turn the tide, our Order embarked on trans-saharan campaigns in the French Sudan and Chad, fighting to preserve the independence of these states and spread the message of our Grandmaster. Pushed back, we saw our territory slink until in 1911 the homeland came under direct attack. Although Italy, after almost a decade of guerrilla warfare, was pushed back into the sea, the French colonial empire still stands, still watches, still hungry..."

### Romania ###
 #ROM_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Treaty of Bucharest ended Romania's war with the Central Powers. While it was considered lenient, its restrictions were enough to fuel a stab-in-the-back myth that, after several crises in the 1920s, overturned the nation's political establishment. The death of King Ferdinand and the country's leading liberal politician would pave the way to two highly ambitious men: King Carol II and Corneliu Zelea Codreanu. The two joined arms to overthrow Romanian democracy and launch a crusade to reunite Romania, but how long can these two strong personalities work together before their ambitions clash in the open?"

#### Costa Rica ###
 #COS_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Class warfare, rapid militarisation and the Iron Grip of the Kaiser hold the world in its grasp, which makes it even more peculiar that in the midst of all this violence and pain we can find the tiny republic of Costa Rica. Taking great pride in their impressive literacy statistics and their unbreakable dedication to the Constitution, the nation stands as a rock above its neighbours who have long been eyeing its land. As their greatest ally starts to descend into chaos, vultures all across the Americas are waiting for the proud eagle to fall. Diplomacy will have to prevail if we are to survive the coming tide..."

#### Cuba ###
 #CUB_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A mere seven years since the overthrow of American-backed dictator Gerardo Machado, Cuba again teeters on the edge of political upheaval. The regime of young President Rafael Trejo has steadily lost control over the Army and the civilian government's political authority has all but completely eroded. As radicals both right and left threaten the country, the military may well take full control as soon as an opportunity presents itself."

#### Denmark ###
 #DEN_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Denmark exists under the shadow of Berlin. Its relation with the new hegemon of the world is ancient, has often been hostile, even as recently as 1864, which resulted in the loss of Slesvig to the Germans. Yet, in 1936, ties are warm and Denmark, by grace of having remained neutral in the Weltkrieg maintains its sovereignty in full. Under the guiding hand of the popular social democratic prime minister Thorvald Stauning, Denmark has been profiting from German economic prosperity. Domestically, the future looks bright, but internationally, clouds are gathering. Some fear Denmark will be in the wrong place at the wrong time..."

#### Dominican Republic ###
 #DOM_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The American Occupation of the Dominican Republic ended in 1924 and full political control was returned soon after, but within a mere few years, the nation's new democratic constitution would face challenges both within and without. While Democracy has so far survived in the nation, the schism of the long-ruling Red Party has again put the constitution's survival in jeopardy."

#### Fengtian Government ###
 #FNG_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Shanghai Conference of 1928 left Fengtian as the sole inheritor of the old Beiyang Republic's legacy. As before, democracy is maintained only as a thin veneer, and real power is divided between a wide variety of unscrupulous autocrats.\n\nZhang Zuolin, his ambitions limited by the stark realities of Qing strength and Japanese power, has been forced to walk a political tightrope above the machinations of his own divided government. The outlook is grim, but some still hold out hope. The Five Colour Flag may again flutter high above Beijing and across all China..."

#### Finland ###
 #FIN_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In the northern periphery of Europe, Finland, the bastion of German influence in Scandinavia, proudly stands. Spawned out of the corpse of the Russian empire and with socialism threatening the nation at its inception, the kingdom has developed into a stalwart ally of Germany against the principles of socialism and the imperialistic hands of Russia. But after almost two decades of independence under the guiding hand of its monarch and the national coalition, unrest is festering: is Finland truly free or is German dominion merely a bit more subtle than that of the Tsars of old?"

#### Guatemala ###
 #GUA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The overthrow of the two-decade-long president Manuel Estrada Cabrera in 1920 and the overthrow of the Unity Party afterwards has led to a decade long dictatorship under José María Orellana. Through various compromises, he has been able to keep power by a string through the Americans and various outside influences. However, the rise of Sandino in Nicaragua has caused extreme trouble for his presidency as socialist movements begin to grow and the Unity Party officials begin to ally with elements of the military. Orellana's dictatorship might have its string cut soon."

#### Honduras ###
 #HON_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The suicide of President Andino in 1933 following the peasant charge of the capital created a shock wave throughout Honduras, soon after a peasant republic was established with the goal of gradually rooting out US influence and purging Pro US elements. In 1936 the Council is on the brink of collapse and there are rumours of a conspiracy within the government..."

#### Iceland ###
 #ICE_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Starting in 1874, Iceland had its first taste of independence when Denmark granted the colony home rule. When the guns fell silent after the Weltkrieg, Iceland joined the Mitteleuropa Economic Bloc which brought a period of prosperity to the island. However, this economic prosperity would not last forever. The British Revolution of 1925 shattered the miracle that post-Weltkrieg Iceland was experiencing. The last decade has seen Iceland floundering as its economy never fully recovered from the loss of Great Britain. Many politicians are now bringing forward further plans to revitalise the island."

#### Italian Republic ###
 #ITA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After Italy's defeat in the Weltkrieg, the country was left to the mercy of the Austrians - and it would have been reorganised into the old Italian Federation had it not been for the outbreak of civil war. The socialists would have overrun the peninsula had the Austrians not swallowed a bitter pill and cooperated with the republicans... and, after the fighting stopped, was forced to maintain the relationship into the current day. Italy remains unstable, however, and its eventual reckoning with the socialists across the Po appears inevitable."

#### League of Eight Provinces ###
 #LEP_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Sun Chuanfang's League forms the southern half of an axis that has dominated China for nearly a decade. Years of peace have proven fertile ground for ambition, and with it jealousy. Although Nanjing and Beijing remain united against external foes, they have become competitors as much as allies. Some say the costs of this contest have already begun to take their toll.\n\nLike much of China the League is the product of a careful balance, and Sun's great bureaucratic pyramid may have already begun to crack and crumble..."

#### Ma Clique ###
 #XSM_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The three Ma families have cemented their north-western rule for thirty steady years. Siding with almost everyone in China at one point or another, with some Mas even fighting each other for the sake of remaining on the good side of everyone, the Mas are now seen as one of the greatest allies of the new Zhili-led Qing Dynasty.\n\nOf course, not all is well. Ma Fuxiang's heart attack three years ago shook the clique, and a sense of anxiety and unrest has slowly spread ever since. For now, the northwest is peaceful, but its future is less certain than many might like to believe..."

#### Mexico ###
 #MEX_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Mexico has come out through the Mexican Revolution changed. During the 1920s the presidencies of Álvaro Obregón and Adolfo de la Huerta would see improved relations with the United States of America while stabilising the country from the revolution. The Great Depression in America has allowed Mexico to embrace the ideas of the Revolution which they have started when they elected Emiliano Zapata as President in 1932. Now with two years left in his term, and the revolution seemingly done, Zapata looks to plot the future course for Mexico."

#### Nicaragua ###
 #NIC_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The occupation of Nicaragua by the United States Marines in 1926 ended in disaster as the liberal revolutionary general expelled them and set up his new 'Revolutionary Republic' within Nicaragua. It soon drifted towards a socialist attitude and underwent not insignificant development but it is not without its troubles. The expelling of large amounts of American companies has left a hole in the economy and the entire eastern side of the country is unofficially demilitarised after a stern warning of entering the region from the Americans. With the elections soon will Nicaragua's fate finally be changed?"

#### Norway ###
 #NOR_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "For Norway, the last two decades could have been better. As a neutral country supportive of the British war effort, the hegemonic power of Germany did not favour the land of the midnight sun and the nation was excluded from the Mitteleuropa project that did include Sweden and Denmark. When Great Britain fell to the hammer and torch, the last trading partner of Norway that was not subject to heavy tariffs was an ocean away. Ever since, Norway found itself in diplomatic and economic isolation, and in the suffering this entails, the syndicalist-inclined Labour Party rises in the polls at an ever-increasing pace."

#### Papal State ###
 #PAP_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the formation of a united Italy, it had seemed the time for the Papal States to have secular power was a thing of the past. Then came the collapse of the kingdom, and the civil war which followed, and central Italians once again turned to the Papacy and its Sicilian allies to help maintain stability. Now Pope Pius XI is ill, and on his deathbed he laments an Italy that remains divided, with the syndicalists growing ever stronger in the north. Whoever his successor is, he will need God on his side in order to prevail."

#### Patagonian Workers Front ###
 #FOP_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Despite the belief that a revolution in the arid wastes of Patagonia would be impossible, the Frente Obrero Patagonico has managed to endure against all odds. Thanks to an opportune Chilean intervention forcing Argentina to accept the new status quo or face a war unprepared at a time of great economic hardship, the FOP has managed to grow in numbers, drawing people disillusioned with the old regime in Argentina. However, the ties that bind the different factions in the FOP are thinner than they look from afar, and perhaps victory in the civil war will only be the match that will set off the powder-keg..."

#### Qing Empire ###
 #QIE_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Qing Empire enters 1936 on the brink. Restored in exchange for German support during the fourth Zhili-Fengtian war in 1927, the Xuantong Emperor remains deeply unpopular and is viewed by many as illegitimate.\n\nThe Zhili clique, who trounced both the Fengtian clique and the KMT, stands as the victor of the chaos that engulfed China since 1911, but their domination of the country is far from secure. Enemies from both outside and within threaten their hegemony, and it remains to be seen how long they can hold on to power..."

#### Sardinia ###
 #SRD_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The House of Savoy was shattered by Italy's defeat in the Weltkrieg, and King Victor Emmanuel III held responsible. All is not completely lost for the monarchy, however. The Savoy-Aostas are powerful supporters, the rightful holders of Sardinia-Piedmont until their lands on the shores were swallowed up by the syndicalists. Now they and what monarchy supporters they can gather hold out on Sardinia, protected by the French Republic and ready to watch for the opportunity where they, too, can one day return home to claim their seat of power."

#### Shandong ###
 #SQI_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Shandong's ruler Zhang Zongchang is preceded only by his armoured train and a monstrous reputation. The 'Dogmeat General' is known for violence, vice and corruption, and under his hand the capital of Jinan has steadily come to mirror its master.\n\nHowever, from the peak of Mount Tai, the elusive patriarch Zhang Tianran eschews the depravity below. Instead, he hopes to turn back China's clock by over a century and guide the country into the arms of his captivating Yiguandao faith. A clash between these contradictory forces may change China forever..."

#### Shanxi Clique ###
 #SHX_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Unlike most other warlord factions, Yan Xishan's Shanxi clique has retained a policy of guarded neutrality for nearly three decades, broken only in times of great threat or great opportunity. Both presented themselves in 1928, and Yan joined Zhang Zuolin against the newly reformed Qing Government.\n\nUnfortunately the subsequent defeat deprived Yan of the eastern portion of his province and forced him to induct Guominjun remnants to bolster his wavering forces. The consequences of 1928 are far from forgotten, and next time Yan must choose a side he must do so wisely... "

#### Sichuan Clique ###
 #SZC_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Sichuan has long been a microcosm of China's many woes, divided and constantly switching controllers since 1911. Yang Sen managed to emerge from the chaos as ruler with help from Wu Peifu's Zhili Clique, but even his control is far from absolute.\n\nFollowing a destructive Tibetan invasion, Yang has come to rely upon internal factions for support, most notably Liu Xiang's Industrial Corps and Deng Xihou's Baoding Department. Meanwhile, the exiled Officer Department has returned to the south with support from Yunnan. The Sichuanese powder-keg may explode once again..."

#### Socialist Republic Italy ###
 #SRI_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since the Italian civil war, the Socialist Republic of Italy has controlled the bulk of Italy. Its rulers know full well that it would have overrun the republicans and the whites, had it not been for the infernal interference of Austria and the pressure applied by Germany. Even today, it is the spectre of interference by Germany and Austria which keeps syndicalism from finishing off the last remnants of Old Italy. The nation bides its time, building its strength, and is fully aware that - once the scale tips - it shall tip in the favour of revolution."

#### Sweden ###
 #SWE_KR_GATHERING_STOR_DESC:0 "In the last decade, Sweden developed itself as a bastion of conservatism under the prosperous rule of prime minister Arvid Lindman, profiting from the fruits of the economic growth in Mitteleuropa during the late 1920s and early 1930s. However, clouds are gathering over Stockholm: in 1934, Arvid Lindman retired as prime minister and has been succeeded by the less charismatic Gösta Bagge, while the social democratic opposition is rallying around their popular party leader Per Albin Hansson. This year Bagge's first elections as prime minister will be held. Can he hold his ground? And if not, can Sweden's democracy survive this sudden reversal?"

#### Two Sicilies ###
 #SIC_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies initially sided with Austria during the civil war, a necessary evil to halt the advance of the Socialist Republic. Later, however, when war with the syndicalists seemed inevitable, the Austrians showed their true colours and abandoned the south. The war never happened, but the Sicilians came into the modern era wiser. They will have a difficult time meeting the more industrialised north head-on, but that war will someday come and they must be ready for it."

#### West Indies Federation ###
 #CAF_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The West Indies Federation was created as a result of the collapse of the British Empire in 1925 due to being unable to exert the influence to control the region directly. After the incorporation of the French colonies in 1927, the country has been home to not only a noticeable class divide but a cultural and ideological one as well. The people and new generation have seen a noticeable drift towards socialist attitudes and preference towards the communards on the mainland. All it could take is one wrong step before chaos erupts on the Indies..."

#### Yunnan Clique ###
 #YUN_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the German re-establishment of the Qing dynasty, the mountainous border province of Yunnan was forced to change its strategy. Governor Tang decided to kowtow to the new Qing Empire, while at the same time opening Yunnan's doors to republican remnants, in order to cement his autonomy and deter action against his notoriously upstart province.\n\nAlthough the situation in China is slowly starting to favour Tang's schemes, it is also beginning to shatter any illusion of provincial unity, as many internal factions no longer see Tang as fit or even sane enough to rule..."
