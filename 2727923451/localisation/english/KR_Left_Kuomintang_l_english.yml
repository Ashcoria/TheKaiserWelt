### Leaders ###
 POLITICS_CHI_SONG_QINGLING_DESC:0 "Song Qingling was the third and final wife of Dr Sun Yat-Sen, the founder and ideological center of the Kuomintang party. After the failure of the Northern Expedition, Song decided to stay in China as an outlaw in southern Fujian out of a strong feeling of patriotism. Despite her lack of initial credentials aside from marriage ties, she has proven herself to be an inspirational leader to the Insurgent Zone and has become the head of the pro-democratisation Minquan Faction."
 POLITICS_CHI_WANG_JINGWEI_DESC:0 "Wang Jingwei is a divisive figure within the KMT that has nevertheless maintained his control over the party leadership for over a decade. His rise to national prominence started shortly before the Xinhai Revolution in 1910 when he failed to assassinate the Qing Regent Zaifeng (Puyi's father), but became a sensationalised revolutionary hero while in captivity.\n\nAfter the Xinhai Revolution, Wang was released and his radical political writings became more famous. Though refusing to sign an oath of personal loyalty to Sun Yat-Sen after his refounding of the KMT, Wang would later become a member and a prominent official in the Guangdong government. Aligning himself with the growing left-radical factions of the KMT and the army’s ‘New Guard’, Wang outmanoeuvred Hu Hanmin in 1925 to become Sun Yat-Sen’s successor.\n\nShortly afterwards, the Northern Expedition and the German Intervention shattered the Guangdong Government. Wang and the other radicals were immediately attacked by Sun Fo and other moderates for the failures of the expedition, but his control over party positions and personal alliances prevented his deposition.\nWang survives to this day by these factors, but he is highly aware that his future leadership rests on what happens in the next attempt at revolution.\n\nIn terms of personality, Wang Jingwei is a flamboyant, blustery character who is a natural orator. His penchant for wearing military uniforms when acting in a position as Commander-In-Chief makes many of his opponents see him as megalomaniacal, but he usually lets actual officers take the lead when it comes to military decisions. His insistence at maintaining an alliance with the Syndicalist powers is only surpassed by his desire to avoid another intervention by Germany or Japan at all costs until China is unified and ready to fight them."
 POLITICS_CHI_SUN_FO_DESC:0 "The eldest son of Dr Sun Yat-Sen, Sun Fo has been a constant presence within the Kuomintang, though not always a prominent or powerful one. While respected because of his father, Sun Fo is not a charismatic or exceptional person himself. The centrist factions in the KMT that have come to be represented by him rely on his familial name and his 'iron neck' to keep their criticisms of the Minsheng program represented within the party's discourse. With control of the Nationalist Government returned to its moderate factions, Sun Fo is in the unenviable position of both having to reconcile with non-syndicalist powers while scaling back the social aspects of the National Revolution."
 POLITICS_CHI_CHEN_DUXIU_DESC:0 "Chen Duxiu is an odd figure in the Kuomintang, as he is both an insider and outsider to the party itself. While a member of the KMT, Chen is also the chairman of the Chinese Syndicalist Party, a heretofore minor player even within the syndicalist politics of urban China. The previous status of the CSP as a "junior partner" in the Nationalist Revolution makes Chen's unlikely election a strain on the Nationalist Government's previous synonymity with the KMT. A prominent intellectual and Xinhai- era revolutionary, Chen's anti-traditionalist bent and background in Marxist theory colours his views of the future development of China."
 POLITICS_CHI_HU_ZONGNAN_DESC:0 "Hu Zongnan was one of Chiang Kai-Shek's most trusted protegés and an exemplary young commander during the Northern Expedition. After the German Intervention, Hu's distrust of the dominant civilian factions and close friendship with Dai Chunfeng led him to resent the politically motivated meddling by the Left KMT's leadership in matters of war. Hu's ties to both the NRA and the ZhongTeJu made him a critical figure in the growth of the bureau and the later success of Dai's coup against the civilian government. Because of his political indispensability and loyalty, Hu was appointed as Acting President for the duration of the \"state of emergency\" that Dai Chunfeng and the ZhongTeJu now govern through. While not an especially charismatic or skilled politician, he and Dai are close friends and his prominence ensures that the army maintains loyalty to the current regime."
 POLITICS_CHI_FANG_ZHIMIN_DESC:0 "One of the most prominent politicians and militia commanders of the JiangFu Insurgency Zone, Fang Zhimin was a Jiangxi native and activist that became a close aide of Song Qingling both in civil and military affairs. His aggressive and dogmatic approach to furthering the Nationalist Revolution led him to first become allied with the Minsheng faction, and later the Chinese Syndicalist Party. The previous status of the CSP as a "junior partner" in the Nationalist Revolution makes Chen's unlikely election a strain on the Nationalist Government's previous synonymity with the KMT. Fang is a dogmatic and charismatic leader who acts as a shaky bridge between the growing radical syndicalist movement and the order established by the KMT."
 POLITICS_CHI_DAI_CHUNFENG_DESC:0 "The notorious 'Hooded Chairman' of the KMT, Dai Chunfeng rose to power first as a minor protegé of the late Marshal Chiang Kai-Shek, and then through his leadership of the ZhongTeJu. Devoted to a very personal interpretation of the Kuomintang's mission to unify and revive China, Dai and his allies seized control of the Nationalist government after a long-standing period of instability made it clear that there was no alternative but the KMT's security apparatus taking the helm of state. As shy of the public spotlight as he is ruthless, Dai is very rarely seen in public, but is known to be an indulgent playboy of a kind when off-duty."
 POLITICS_CHI_ZHOU_ENLAI_DESC:0 "Despite his unassuming work in the background over the years, Zhou Enlai is an exceptional politician and statesman. Born into a prominent family of clerks, Zhou was educated at westernised schools in both China, France, and Japan. After becoming radicalised by the revolutionary ideals of the early 1920s, Zhou joined the KMT and rapidly rose in its ranks upon merit, eventually becoming its chief foreign minister in the mid-1930s.\nA prominent member of the Minsheng faction, Zhou has also been integral in maintaining good relations between the KMT party and its military wings, especially as the Nationalists continue their reorganisation into a proper nation-state."

 POLITICS_CHI_Li_JISHEN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nNovember 6th, 1885\nWuzhou, Guangxi, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nFavoured by Guangzhou government before the dawn of the Northern Expedition, Li Jishen became the Chief of General Staff and was in charge of KMT organs, administrations as well as the military in the whole province of Guangdong. When the Expedition failed, he abandoned Guangzhou, forced to leave for the 4th Army, which was under his direct command. Facing him was a series of malicious accusations by other officers, as well as his own subordinates, who blamed him for not securing Guangzhou. Li retained his position in the Central Committee as several of his detractors went into exile abroad with their misgivings towards him alive and well. Despite his efforts to aid the leftist cadres and commanders trying to escape to the Commune of France, he was still being isolated and nominally assigned as the Chief of Army Staff in China. Inspired by agrarian movements and supported by Soong Ching-ling and Deng Yanda, he gathered the remnant of his forces, establishing the Drngxi-Fujian guerrilla zone. Li, being assigned as the Commander in Chief by the Central Committee, is currently following Wang Jingwei’s order to rally exiled veterans for another insurrection. While waiting for a new revolution, Li is studying the Weltkrieg-era strategies and tactics."
 POLITICS_CHI_CHENG_QIAN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nMarch 31st, 1882\nLiling, Hunan, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nAs a veteran revolutionary, Chen Qian’s seniority made him one of the top commanders of troops belonging to the central committee of KMT. More conservative than some of his peers, Chen partially approved of the switch towards guerrilla tactics proposed by Li Jishen after the failure of the Northern Expedition. He's still considered to be a respectable officer with significant support in Hunan, which could be used by the KMT to improve the chances of their next revolution and open the door to more opportunities in the future."
 POLITICS_CHI_XUE_YUE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nDecember 27th, 1896\nShaoguan, Guangdong, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nXue Yue joined the Revolutionary Party has been a firm believer in Dr. Sun's revolutionary ideals ever since. After the failure of the Northern Expedition, Xue Yue was relegated to rearguard actions several times as his tendency towards more right-wing views made him distrusted with some of his peers. Despite this, he always performed his duties well and would later rendezvous with the main forces. After being forced into exile along with several members of the Central Committee he was appointed to the Bharatiya Commune as an attaché. Unhappy with this post so far from home, he repeatedly tried to gain permission to return to China to rejoin the revolutionary struggle."
 POLITICS_CHI_DENG_YANDA_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nMarch 1st, 1895\nHuizhou, Guangdong, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nAfter the establishment of the Whampoa Military Academy, Deng Yanda served as a minister among them. Later, because of the discord between his political ideas and Chiang Kai-shek's, Deng Yanda volunteered to study in France. During his time there, he heard the news of Sun Yat-sen's death. He worked hard and returned home to participate in the Northern Expedition after completing his studies in advance. After the failure of the Northern Expedition, however, Deng Yanda decided to cooperate with Wang Ching-wei. After some discussions between the two, Wang Ching-wei went into exile while Deng Yanda stayed in China, and then he helped Li Jishen create the Jiangxi-Fujian guerrilla zone to resist and began to plan for the next revolution."
 POLITICS_CHI_ZHANG_FAKUI_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nSeptember 2nd, 1896\nShaoguan, Guangdong, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nZhang Fakui is fiercely loyal to Sun's revolutionary ideals. He commanded the 4th "Iron" Army during the Northern Expedition but was discontent with the leadership of Li Jishen's leadership after its failure. Knowing that the revolutionary cause was bigger than one man, he remained loyal to the left KMT government. However, he fell into the internal party conflicts which ended up making his views more right-wing, earning him a reputation as one of the most right-wing officers in the KMT officer corps. He later left for the Commune of France and would then become an attaché in the Bharatiya Commune with Xue Yue. He has extensive ties and connections to the DVQDD and he is actively training both Indochinese rebels as well as his own forces."
 POLITICS_CHI_YE_TING_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nSeptember 10th, 1896\nHuizhou, Guangdong, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nYe Ting began his military career by fighting against China's many warlords in several battles. He would later study in the Commune of France where he was influenced by Syndicalist thought and ended up joining the Chinese Syndicalist Party after returning to China. Back in the homeland, Ye earned a great reputation for his victory in the Battle of the Ting Si Bridge. Due to the eventual failure of the Northern Expedition, Ye had to retreat to the south with the Nationalist Government. Facing such a dire situation, Ye volunteered to lead the NRA in the Jiangxi-Fujian Guerrilla Zone with Li Jishen. Ye is also one of the few Chinese generals interested in air forces."
 POLITICS_CHI_LIN_BIAO_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nDecember 5th, 1907\nHuanggang, Hubei, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nHaving participated in the anti-imperialist movement as a student, Lin Biao went south to the Whampoa Military Academy after graduating from high school. During his time at the academy, he became fascinated with the ideals of syndicalism. Such a unique act made him famous in that academy and eventually gained the attention of Ye Ting, who decided to give him special care in the future. Though young and favoured, he had shown outstanding performance before his graduation. After the defeat in the Northern Expedition, he initially decided to pursue further education abroad according to Ye's suggestions, but he finally followed the party's decision and stayed in China, leading guerrilla forces in the Jiangxi-Fujian Guerrilla Zone."
 POLITICS_CHI_XIAO_KE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nJuly 14th, 1907\nJiahe, Hunan, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nXiao Ke joined the northern expedition when he graduated from the Whampoa Military Academy. When the Kuomintang was defeated in the Northern Expedition, he stayed in the region of Jiangxi and Fujian where he followed general Ye Ting to fight against the military forces of the League of Eight Provinces. After having led his forces in several battles, Xiao Ke became a new commander of the NRA. Despite having participated in several battles, he's still young a lacks experience outside of guerrilla warfare."
 POLITICS_CHI_SUN_LIREN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nDecember 8th, 1900\nLujiang, Anhui, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nSun Liren was qualified for the Boxer Indemnity scholar as he got the best grade in Anhui Province. Purdue graduate, later studied at Sandhurst as the United States wasn’t regarded as much of a modern military power. In 1925, he participated in the British Revolution with his classmates. He was profoundly affected by the revolution and decided to join the KMT even after the failure of the Northern Expedition rather than joining any of the factions that he considered to be led by warlords. After that, he was appointed by Song Qingling as KMT's attaché of UoB, and he continues his military studies of the UoB's Republican Army's doctrines, hoping to put them to good use in the next revolution. Sun Liren is good at sports from his time as a student and in his military career, he combines sports with military training, which has helped him excel in his military training."
 POLITICS_CHI_WANG_YAOWU_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1904\nTaian, Shandong, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nWang Yaowu was born to a peasant family in Shandong Province. When the Whampoa military academy was founded, Wang Yaowu, who worked in Shanghai, decided to go south to join the revolution immediately. After the failure of the Northern Expedition, Wang Yaowu followed Soong Chingling and remained in the Jiangxi-Fujian guerrilla area for resistance. Wang Yaowu was good at defence, and successfully repelled the attack of Sun Chuanfang's troops on many occasions when the Northern Expedition failed and the LEP forces besieged and suppressed the guerrilla areas. Therefore, there was a saying among the Beiyang troops that "It is better to meet the King of Hell than to see the King Yaowu", a reference to Wang's pronunciation being the same as \"the King\"."
 POLITICS_CHI_DAI_ANLAN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nNovember 25th, 1904\nWuwei, Anhui, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nDai Anlan, originally named Bingyang, was born to a farmer's family. After witnessing the corruption of the Beiyang government, he decided to rename himself Anlan to show his goals and devoted himself to the revolution led by Kuomintang. During one battle of the Northern Expedition, he was badly injured when he was shot in the belly. However, despite his injuries, his feats earned him a lot of praise as he became a favourite of the leaders. When the Northern Expedition failed, Dai retreated with the National Revolutionary Army under Zhou Enlai's special instructions, eventually escaping to the Commune of France. When Dai was recovering in France, he was surprised and inspired by the modern armoured warfare theory of Charles Delestraint, which made him study the field of mobile warfare and the use of tanks in the battlefield."

Because of the Revolutionary ideological trend, he chose to enter The Whampoa Military Academy. After the end of the Eastern Expedition, he was selected as the representative of Liao Zhongkai to go to Beijing. He visited Sun Yat-sen who was in a coma and joined the agents’ battalion to guard the bier of Sun after his death. In 1926, he decided to return to the team. Unexpectedly, he was arrested by Sun Chuanfang. He finally broke out of prison and was rescued by Deng Yanda during the siege of Nanjing. After the defeat in Northern Expedition, under the arrangement of Deng Yanda, Du Yuming went to France with Wang Jingwei whom he once had met. Active and bold in thinking, he was soon attracted by the theory of mobile warfare. Because of this, he studied with Dai Anlan."

In 1919, Cai Chang and Xiang Jingyu, her classmate, initiated a Diligent Work-Frugal Study Movement to study in France. During that period she was attracted to the blooming Syndicalist Revolution and joined the group of Deng Xiaoping and Zhou Enlai, although she was later influenced by more social democratic ideals. After the failure of the Northern Expedition, thanks to her experience of studying in France and her great relationship with Song Qingling, she became the representative of the Mingquan Faction in France. Her amiable character and helpful heart have also earned her the nickname “Auntie Cai”. She has become very popular among the Kuomintang soldiers, which is very suitable for both internal and external propaganda efforts."

 POLITICS_CHI_XU_XIANGQIAN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nNovember 8th, 1901\nWutai, Shanxi, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nWhile working as a teacher, Xu Xiangqian spared no effort to spread patriotic and progressive thoughts to students, which later caused him to be fired from that job. Therefore, Xu chose to move southwards to join Sun Yat-Sen’s Revolutionary Guards, and later participated in the wars against Chen Jiongming and the Northern Expedition. After the failure of the Northern Expedition, Xu was dissatisfied with the power struggle inside KMT, so he moved to Guangzhou and took part in the Guangzhou Revolution, as well as trying to follow Peng Pai, fighting in the guerrilla zone in the Haifeng-Lufeng area like Li Jishen did before the Germans routed them. Finally, Xu had to transfer, they successfully merged in to Jiangfu guerrilla zone, but Xu refused Wang Jingwei’s offer to leave for France. He voluntarily decided to stay in China, only to continue his fighting.\nThere is a sharp contrast to Xu’s wordless and serious character when directing a battle, and the fact that he privately is an animal lover that enjoys the Shanxi and Cantonese operas."

He joined the Guangdong Army several times but he always remained a staunch supporter of the Three Principles of the People. After the failure of the Northern Expedition, although Zhang supported the decision made by the KMT central committee to reinstate Li Jishen, he left for Guangxi under the instruction of Deng Yanda.\nWhen the news of the establishment of Jiangfu guerrilla zone spreads and the conflicts between the New Guangxi clique and old Guangxi clique escalated, Zhang Yunyi and Deng Xiaoping left the front line and established the You Jiang guerrilla zone. This enraged Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi, who saw it as the kind of betrayal that led to the failure of the Northern Expedition. And this finally leads to the split between Leftist KMT and them. They accept the advice from Lu Rongting and Liu Wen. Under combined assaults from multiple sides, the You Jiang guerrilla zone eventually fell and both Zhang and Deng began to pull out and arrived JiangFu guerrilla zone with Xu Xiangqian."

After graduating from the Navy school with the highest score in his class, he joined the navy and began his service career. In 1916, he was sent to the United States to study aircraft and submarines, and to observe the war in Europe. When the Northern Expedition broke out in 1926, Chen Shaokuan, who supported the revolution, turned his back on Sun Chuanfang and joined the National Revolutionary Army. Unfortunately, with the arrival of the German Navy, Chen Shaokuan had to abandon his ship and follow the Kuomintang central committee to exile in the Commune of France. Under the leadership of Soong Chingling, Chen Shaokuan later went to the Union of Britain where he devoted himself to the study of the Republican Navy's aircraft carrier doctrines."

### Focuses ###
 CHI_jiangfu:0 "Establish JiangFu Base Government"
 CHI_jiangfu_desc:0 "With our uprising in full swing, the time has come to move out of the wilderness of Fujian Province and establish a provisional Nationalist government in areas under our control."
 CHI_ruijin_arsenal:0 "The 'Hundred Workshops' Arsenal"
 CHI_ruijin_arsenal_desc:0 "The centre of the Base Zone is remote and barely industrialised, which will be a problem as we switch to active warfare against the warlords. To mitigate our problems, a program establishing a highly-decentralised manufacturing base for repairing and replacing infantry equipment needs to be established."
 CHI_literacy_programs:0 "Rural Literacy Programs"
 CHI_literacy_programs_desc:0 "Much of the rural population of China is too poorly-educated to be trained for modern warfare, let alone as specialists. A Minsheng-endorsed program to provide literacy education for both adults and children should be implemented as soon as possible to counteract these problems."
 CHI_strike_AOG:0 "Seize German Capital"
 CHI_strike_AOG_desc:0 "The robber-barons and imperialists of Germany have been content to let these local warlords abuse and harvest our nation's interior, while their commissioners idly collect the dividends in their 'treaty ports.' The KMT will not stand this any longer. Any capital held by the AOG shall be immediately requisitioned and any land seized must be taken from their foreign hands."
 CHI_consolidate_control:0 "Consolidate Control"
 CHI_consolidate_control_desc:0 "With our rebellion shifting towards conventional warfare, we must begin to also change our governing style as well. It is now essential that we begin governing the base region and other liberated territories as a functional state rather than as a secret rural government."
 CHI_est_navy:0 "Establish Naval Presence"
 CHI_est_navy_desc:0 "The Nationalists are in desperate need of a merchant marine and armed escorts that can connect us to friendly trading partners. Reorganising the commandeered seaworthy ships seized by our armies will take time, but it is an important step towards creating a new Chinese navy."
 CHI_jiangxi_rail:0 "Control The Central China Railroad"
 CHI_jiangxi_rail_desc:0 "The Central China Railroad- a local name for the new lines that connect Zhejiang to the interior- are critical for our supply lines in this early period of the revolution. Up until now, the railway has operated according to the demands of foreign capital, but we can run it more efficiently and with better purposes ourselves."
 CHI_warlord_research_group:0 "Extra-Military Research Coordination"
 CHI_warlord_research_group_desc:0 "Our alliances with the pro-KMT warlords will be ineffective if we do not cooperate to some extent. By sharing and mandating technical specifications with these armies, we can make sure that our forces and logistics will be able to operate anywhere that they need us to- or that we need them to."

 CHI_provisional_code:0 "Provisional Legal Code"
 CHI_provisional_code_desc:0 "During the early stages of the revolution, Chinese territory reclaimed by the Kuomintang has to be administered in a manner much different from the later democratic republic it will become. While supporting military operations must be prioritised, the Central Committee should also begin establishing civil courts and reintroduce the old organic law code to maintain peace, stability, and most importantly, tax revenues."
 CHI_expropriate_landlords:0 "Expropriate Landlords"
 CHI_expropriate_landlords_desc:0 "Private landlords control the vast majority of China's arable land, and as Black Monday's financial after-effects worm their way into the Chinese economy, tenant farmers suffer from ever-higher land rents. Rather than a more complicated process of regulating land rent rates, the KMT should instead seize the land of the largest landlords in liberated regions and return it to the farmers."
 CHI_land_rent_caps:0 "Land Rent Caps"
 CHI_land_rent_caps_desc:0 "Private landlords control the vast majority of China's arable land, and as Black Monday's financial after-effects worm their way into the Chinese economy, tenant farmers suffer from ever-higher land rents. Rather than simply seize and redistribute the land, the KMT should enforce a cap on land rent values to prevent the worst of the economic downturn from affecting agricultural workers."
 CHI_land_tax:0 "Land Use Tax"
 CHI_land_tax_desc:0 "The concept of a Land Value or Land Use Tax has been a policy darling of progressive reformers worldwide and is most associated with the economic theories of Henry George. Since the earliest days of the KMT, the Land Use Tax has been unanimously approved by the party, and its legal implementation will ensure both a continual source of income and a passive means of fighting wealth accumulation."
 CHI_opium_prohibition:0 "Opium Prohibition"
 CHI_opium_prohibition_desc:0 "Opium has been the scourge of China since the beginning of the Century of Humiliation, and vast swathes of south-east China suffer from endemic opiate addiction. As a matter of national security and pride, we must not just eradicate opium production but also crack down on its trade and possession within controlled territories."
 CHI_opium_tax:0 "Tax The Opium Trade"
 CHI_opium_tax_desc:0 "Opium addiction and trafficking is a serious issue in China, but we realistically cannot do more than ban its production within our territories and crack down on smuggling. Prohibitive taxes on opium sold within legal channels will allow this vice to be used for the good of the country's treasury."
 CHI_gannan_deal:0 "Gannan New Deal"
 CHI_gannan_deal_desc:0 "There are proposals within the Minquan faction to turn Gannan Province into a model region for future Chinese development. Social programs such as state orphanages, free clinics and schools, and public housing may show to the world that even in the most remote regions of a wartorn China, the Nationalists are dedicated to improving the quality of life for all citizens."

 CHI_yangste_offensive:0 "Prepare Lower Yangtze Offensive"
 CHI_yangste_offensive_desc:0 "The League of Eight Provinces is shattered, but its core, the Nanjing Clique, still survives and may stabilise itself soon. To finally upend the status quo in Southern China, we need to strike at their centre of power in Jiangsu Province. Our ace in the hole is the ZhongTeJu bureau, which has filled the Clique's territory with Nationalist cells that will surely cause mass sabotage of their defences."
 CHI_contact_cells:0 "Reorganise Nationalist Cells"
 CHI_contact_cells_desc:0 "As more of China is liberated from the warlords, the KMT's structure as an underground party becomes pointless. We need loyal and competent party members to help administer the governments of the prefectures, and these local party members are the ideal candidates. Party cells in controlled regions should be reorganised into regional Party Directorates until a more formalised government is established."
 CHI_handle_SQI:0 "Handle The Millenarians"
 CHI_handle_SQI_desc:0 "The province of Shandong has been brought directly into contact with us thanks to the League War. If we are to ever take China for the people we must deal with this potential threat, preventing it from spreading through the southeast."
 CHI_VNQDD_liasons:0 "Liaison with DVQDD Rebels"
 CHI_VNQDD_liasons_desc:0 "The DVQDD, or 'Dai Viet Kuomintang,' is our sister organisation in Indochina and is just as devoted to the cause of democratic anti-imperialism in Asia as we are. With our borders touching the Indochinese region, we may be able to more closely aid and cooperate with them as part of their work within the wider world of native Indochinese politics."
 CHI_plan_southern:0 "Unite Southern China"
 CHI_plan_southern_desc:0 "The Kuomintang must control or pacify the rest of Southern China before any attempt at a second Northern Expedition can take place. To this end, the National Revolutionary Army must begin planning expeditions against the remaining independent southern warlords with the intelligence and special operations aid of the ZhongTeJu."
 CHI_plan_western:0 "Plan Western Expedition"
 CHI_plan_western_desc:0 "The far-western regions of Yunnan and Sichuan may seem like a sideshow to the struggle for dominance of China, but securing their loyalty and resources may prove the difference between victory and defeat. Without any other paths towards a diplomatic solution, we may have to resort to a military campaign against the south-western warlords."

 CHI_mingshu:0 "Chen Mingshu Victorious"
 CHI_mingshu_desc:0 "With the KMT revolt in Fujian a failure it is now up to Chen Mingshu to ensure China is under Kuomintang rule. There are still problems facing Chen such as the powerful gentry and merchants, on top of that there is unrest in Liangguang which we will need to deal with."
 CHI_National_Plan:0 "The National Plan"
 CHI_National_Plan_desc:0 "With the National Plan we can use elements of Chen Jiongmings government to make the integration of China a lot easier. This is because his form of government was based on the American states which makes it more appealing for the governors as they can retain some autonomy for the time being."
 CHI_Respect_Chen_Jiongming:0 "Implementing Guangdong Policies"
 CHI_Respect_Chen_Jiongming_desc:0 "The lands of the potential United Provinces are under our control however that doesn't mean we can't fulfil Chen's legacy. If we fine-tune his ideals to fit with ours we could gain a large amount of wealth and support from the people."
 CHI_opium_prohibition2:0 "Opium Prohibition"
 CHI_opium_prohibition2_desc:0 "Opium has been the scourge of China since the beginning of the Century of Humiliation, and vast swathes of south-east China suffer from endemic opiate addiction. As a matter of national security and pride, we must not just eradicate opium production but also crack down on its trade and possession within controlled territories."
 CHI_opium_tax2:0 "Tax The Opium Trade"
 CHI_opium_tax2_desc:0 "Opium addiction and trafficking is a serious issue in China, but we realistically cannot do more than ban its production within our territories and crack down on smuggling. Prohibitive taxes on opium sold within legal channels will allow this vice to be used for the good of the country's treasury."
 CHI_guangdong_deal:0 "Guangdong New Deal"
 CHI_guangdong_deal_desc:0 "The Guangdong Province is a true example of a model region for future Chinese development. If we try to bring Social programs such as state orphanages, free clinics and schools, and public housing to other provinces in our control we may show to the world that even in the most remote regions of a wartorn China, the Nationalists are dedicated to improving the quality of life for all citizens."
 CHI_Consolidate_Liangguang:0 "Consolidate Liangguang"
 CHI_Consolidate_Liangguang_desc:0 "The pressing issues that arose both before and after the civil war still need to be addressed, until they are sorted the Northern Expedition will have to wait until a later date which gives the enemy more time the prepare."
 CHI_Manage_Unrest_In_Guangxi:0 "Control the Unrest in Guangxi"
 CHI_Manage_Unrest_In_Guangxi_desc:0 "Guangxi has not been spared the turmoil that has gripped large parts of China following the collapse of the League. Our new administration must tend to the unrest in this province, be it from reactionaries, bandits or Yiguandao agitators."
 CHI_Manage_Unrest_In_Guangdong:0 "Control the Unrest in Guangdong"
 CHI_Manage_Unrest_In_Guangdong_desc:0 "Much of this province still bears the influence of warlord dominance that threaten the stability of the people's government. Efforts should be made to put an end to their influence."
 CHI_expropriate_landlords2:0 "Expropriate Landlords"
 CHI_expropriate_landlords2_desc:0 "Private landlords control the vast majority of China's arable land, and as Black Monday's financial after-effects worm their way into the Chinese economy, tenant farmers suffer from ever-higher land rents. Rather than a more complicated process of regulating land rent rates, the KMT should instead seize the land of the largest landlords in liberated regions and return it to the farmers."
 CHI_land_rent_caps2:0 "Land Rent Caps"
 CHI_land_rent_caps2_desc:0 "Private landlords control the vast majority of China's arable land, and as Black Monday's financial after-effects worm their way into the Chinese economy, tenant farmers suffer from ever-higher land rents. Rather than simply seize and redistribute the land, the KMT should enforce a cap on land rent values to prevent the worst of the economic downturn from affecting agricultural workers."
 CHI_Dealing_With_SZC:0 "Reconcile with KMT in Sichuan"
 CHI_Dealing_With_SZC_desc:0 "In the chaotic world of Sichuanese politics, the Officer Department is the only group with a favourable view of the KMT. By supporting Officer Department in their provincial power struggles, we could gain a valuable ally or even control of the entire province through them."
 CHI_Dealing_With_YUN:0 "Reconciliation with KMT in Yunnan"
 CHI_Dealing_With_YUN_desc:0 "After the Northern Expedition, the remnants of the armies controlled by the Right KMT found refuge in Yunnan province. With the victory of the Center-Right KMT in Yunnan's recent power struggles, we may have a chance to mend the old Nationalist party together and form a powerful front to unify South China together."
 CHI_Dealing_With_HNN:0 "Support KMT in Hunan"
 CHI_Dealing_With_HNN_desc:0 "The only remaining democracy in Hunan was discovered by some members of the Kuomintang. However, Hunan Clique is still firmly controlled by non-KMT forces, and our revolutionary progress is developing very slowly there. By expanding the influence of KMT in Hunan Province, it will make it easier for us to revolutionise."
 CHI_Gentry_Concession:0 "Provide Gentry Concessions"
 CHI_Gentry_Concession_desc:0 "The gentry and their excesses are a product of a bad system. Instead of taking a heavy-handed approach, we can make concessions towards them and win their support. It'll be easier than fighting them every step of the way, allowing us to move forward with our reforms without major disruptions to the existing economic infrastructure."
 CHI_Gentry_Force:0 "Crack Down on the Gentry"
 CHI_Gentry_Force_desc:0 "The upper classes are but leeches that suck the blood out of the worker. Their excesses end here. We'll make them abide by the rules just like everyone else and work just like everyone else. There will be some inevitable transitional pains to the economy, but it's a price worth paying for justice."
 CHI_Merchants_Concession:0 "Provide Merchant Concessions"
 CHI_Merchants_Concession_desc:0 "While it's true that the merchant classes have lived off the people, we can't uproot the entire commercial system overnight. By making certain concessions to the merchant classes to have them support us and adapt to our rule, we should see a smoother transition for the people's government."
 CHI_Merchants_Force:0 "Crack Down on the Merchants"
 CHI_Merchants_Force_desc:0 "We cannot count the number of times that the merchants have squeezed every last penny out of the commoner without a care for his plight. It's time that we started to put the screws on these jackals and have them contribute to the common good for a change, even if that means that there will be a period of adjustment."
 CHI_Revoloution_Secured:0 "Revolution Secured"
 CHI_Revoloution_Secured_desc:0 "Our revolutionary brothers and sisters may have fallen, but not in vain. We shall pick up the torch of revolution where they left off and continue their work towards a better China. Through us, the Kuomintang rises again like a mighty phoenix!"
 CHI_plan_west:0 "Plan Western Expedition"
 CHI_plan_west_desc:0 "The far-western regions of Yunnan and Sichuan may seem like a sideshow to the struggle for dominance of China, but securing their loyalty and resources may prove the difference between victory and defeat. Without any other paths towards a diplomatic solution, we may have to resort to a military campaign against the south-western warlords."
 CHI_plan_east:0 "Strike East"
 CHI_plan_east_desc:0 "The Kuomintang must control or pacify the rest of Southern China before any attempt at a second Northern Expedition can take place. To this end, the National Revolutionary Army must begin planning expeditions against the remaining independent southern warlords with the intelligence and special operations aid of the ZhongTeJu."

 CHI_form_army:0 "The 2nd NRA"
 CHI_form_army_desc:0 "We are now in open revolt, and as such our military forces must move from insurgency tactics back to conventional warfare against the Warlords. More units must be raised in larger formations, and in doing so we will form a Second National Revolutionary Army to finally unify China."
 CHI_regional_militias:0 "Regional Militias"
 CHI_regional_militias_desc:0 "With the collapse of League authority in Fujian and Jiangxi province, local self-defence societies have formed to maintain order. We must try to integrate them into the NRA's structure as regional militias to bolster our small core forces."
 CHI_one_army:0 "One-Nation-One-Army Policy"
 CHI_one_army_desc:0 "Local forces loyal to a general or town instead of the Party-State cannot be trusted, and relying on them is a devil's bargain. These bandits and petty warlords need to be neutralised by security sweeps before they can establish themselves. The byline of 'One-Nation-One-Army' should be taken to heart in our military planning and future expansion of the NRA."
 CHI_tigress_battalions:0 "Tigress Battalions"
 CHI_tigress_battalions_desc:0 "The NRA has seen the equal valour of women in combat, though it has not yet developed any programs to fully allow women to participate as enlisted soldiers or officers. Upon the urging of Song Qingling, the NRA has begun a formal program to train women as officers and soldiers. The program also envisions training all-female 'tigress battalions' for front line and garrison duties."
 CHI_peoples_army:0 "Prioritize Manpower"
 CHI_peoples_army_desc:0 "China has a vast population, and we should expect our enemies to have vast armies as well. Trying to outperform our enemies by investing in a quality that our industries are in no shape to supply will cause our armies to be greatly overwhelmed by the sheer size of warlords armies that have built up over time. Nothing less than turning the NRA into a mass People's Army will suffice given the foes we are up against."
 CHI_modern_divisions:0 "Prioritize Modernisation"
 CHI_modern_divisions_desc:0 "Any new Chinese army needs to be founded again from first principles as a modern force. While we should try to maximise the number of units raised for the war, our equipment procurement and plans for expansion should prioritize creating new and modern forces that are not just superior to the haphazard divisions of the warlords, but equal in quality to those of western powers."
 CHI_asymmetrical_warfare:0 "Asymmetrical Warfare"
 CHI_asymmetrical_warfare_desc:0 "As we evolve the National Revolutionary Army from a guerrilla force into a fully-fledged army, our vast experience in fighting unconventionally against the rigid formations of the warlords should be developed, not squandered. By having our training empathise this we'll be able to excel where purely conventional armies struggle."
 CHI_dare_to_die:0 "Dare-To-Die Corps"
 CHI_dare_to_die_desc:0 "It is a sad fact that in these desperate times, often all a man is able to give to a cause is his life. The concept of 'Dare-To-Die' soldiers as patriotic martyrs dates back to the Xinhai Revolution, but during the Warlord Era, the term expanded to refer to all small units tasked with suicidal attacks. As the war expands Dare-To-Die tactics and the original Xinhai spirit that accompanied it begin to show their appeal."
 CHI_airborne_corps:0 "Airborne Corps"
 CHI_airborne_corps_desc:0 "Control of the skies in the wars for China is both possible and plausible, and it is under these conditions that we can try to establish our own airborne corps similar to those of other nations. A properly-placed paradrop will allow our forces to develop new flanking manoeuvrers and keep our enemies fearful of the skies."
 CHI_conscription:0 "Conscription Squads"
 CHI_conscription_desc:0 "Unfortunately, forming an adequately-sized army on volunteers alone is not possible at this stage in the revolution. By forming special task forces to enforce conscription in liberated territories, our armies can more easily reach their projected build-up quotas."
 CHI_mechanized_warfare:0 "Mechanised Warfare Study Commission"
 CHI_mechanized_warfare_desc:0 "Armoured vehicles have been sparse in Chinese warfare, but regardless of our opinion that will not be for long. As a matter of national security, the Nationalists should be the first faction in China to study, perfect and introduce motorised vehicles and tank warfare into the Chinese theatre in mass numbers."
 CHI_stratified:0 "Stratified Unit Quality"
 CHI_stratified_desc:0 "Due to the size and scope of the NRA's forces, we cannot realistically make all of our forces trained or equipped to the same quality. Our backline and low-priority units should be de-prioritised in terms of equipment and training in order to maximise the quality of our front line troops."
 CHI_blocking_detachments:0 "Encirclement Detachments"
 CHI_blocking_detachments_desc:0 "The rugged and mountainous regions of China are far beyond the capacity of regular troops to adequately navigate. For future campaigns in China and beyond, specialised detachments of infantry need to be trained for mountain warfare against smaller local forces."
 CHI_modern_combined_arms:0 "Modern Combined Arms"
 CHI_modern_combined_arms_desc:0 "The art of synchronising artillery, infantry, and armour into a successful offence is still new, but we cannot let other powers develop the perfect implementation ahead of us. The National Revolution's wars will allow us to learn what technical specifications are needed to create ideal arms and artillery for modern wars."

 CHI_restore_whampoa:0 "Restore The Academy"
 CHI_restore_whampoa_desc:0 "The old military academy in Whampoa was officially disestablished after the German intervention in China occupied Guangdong Province in 1925, but its staff, records, and other resources all survived and are currently spread across the world. We are now in a position to re-found the Republic of China Military Academy and begin training our officer corps independent of other powers."
 CHI_nat_air_army:0 "National Air Army"
 CHI_nat_air_army_desc:0 "Up until now the NRA's doctrine and use of military aircraft has been largely hypothetical or improvisational. However, the Weltkrieg has proved that airpower in modern warfare is an undeniable factor in victory. With the growth of our industrial base and funds allowing for actual air fleets to be assembled, we can now fully commit to establishing a new branch of the NRA- the National Air Army."
 CHI_flexible_aircraft:0 "Flexible Aircraft Specifications"
 CHI_flexible_aircraft_desc:0 "China does not have the mechanical skill or industrial depth to have the best native avionic designs for each application of airpower in war. Because of these constraints, it is best to focus on producing cheap, reliable, and flexible plane designs that can work as both support craft and strategic bombers."
 CHI_heavy_airframes:0 "Heavy Airframes Focus"
 CHI_heavy_airframes_desc:0 "China is vast, and our air force will be stretched thin to cover all combat regions. Prioritising the development of long-distance, heavy-frame aircraft can allow us to let air wings be strategically flexible in their choice of targets or supporting missions."
 CHI_build_airfields:0 "Strategic Airfields Initiative"
 CHI_build_airfields_desc:0 "It is easier to build an airfield than a highway, and in the underdeveloped Chinese interior roads are scarce. Building strategic airfields at key regions in provinces will allow for both better communication with the Central Government and also allow for air support in nearby battle zones."
 CHI_naval_aviation:0 "Coast-to-Ship Air Support"
 CHI_naval_aviation_desc:0 "Naval aviation in the sense of carrier forces is currently beyond China's capability or needs, but torpedo bombers and seaplanes are necessary for any proactive coastal defence. Anti-ship squadrons that are stationed on land will be just as useful in repelling attacks and securing littoral zones as any aircraft carrier."

 CHI_separate_naval_command:0 "Separate Naval Command"
 CHI_separate_naval_command_desc:0 "Up until now much of the Republic of China Navy has been effectively subordinated to the needs of the NRA. However, any nation that wants security on its own terms needs to have a strong navy. As victories mount on land, Admiral Chen Shaokuan has pushed for more independence for the Navy and for serious consideration of building up a navy capable of independent operations at sea."
 CHI_coastal_fleets:0 "Light Ship Focus"
 CHI_coastal_fleets_desc:0 "China's naval forces have always been reliant on foreign shipyards and designers for its fleets. The first generation of all-Chinese fleet production should focus on the development of light and heavy cruisers for the most economical and versatile results, as opposed to plunging into the more doctrinally-uncertain world of battleships and carriers."
 CHI_coastal_defenses:0 "Coastal Defence Stratagems"
 CHI_coastal_defenses_desc:0 "China's greatest naval concern is securing its coastline against the imperial powers. Coordination between all involved parties- coastal NRA garrisons, air wings, and the navy- should be enforced by the Central Government and specific mixed-service chains of command and protocols should be pre-established to prevent any operational chaos."
 CHI_integrate_beiyang_navy:0 "Fate of Beiyang Naval Staff"
 CHI_integrate_beiyang_navy_desc:0 "The Nationalist government's navy is small and lacking in trained officers. While the warlordism of the Zhili army is irredeemable, the Beiyang Navy's command structure may have enough officers of decent moral quality that it may be beneficial to review their records and offer the trustworthy a commission now that the Qing and Zhili jackals have finally been put down."
 CHI_submarine_doctrine:0 "Study Submarine Warfare"
 CHI_submarine_doctrine_desc:0 "Submarine warfare has allowed other nations with a seeming naval disadvantage to strike fear into the merchant marines of their enemies. Given the effectiveness of these forces during the Weltkrieg and afterwards, many admirals argue that the ROCN should turn towards submarine warfare as a way to leapfrog past the old paradigm of surface navies with vulnerable capital ships."
 CHI_naval_infantry:0 "Chinese Naval Infantry"
 CHI_naval_infantry_desc:0 "The modern art of coastal landings opens up not just unexpected feints across the Yellow Sea or Gulf of Hanoi, but also the retaking of Taiwan from the Japanese. A joint program by the NRA and ROCN to develop specialised naval infantry regiments will help to keep our enemies on their toes and our strategic options as open as the ocean's horizon."

 CHI_military_affairs_cmsn:0 "Military Affairs Commission"
 CHI_military_affairs_cmsn_desc:0 "With the expansion of the NRA into multiple branches in multiple front regions, a new central command overseeing all theatres of the revolution must be established. Though a formality, this commission should ensure that all decision-makers are on the same page and know our capabilities."
 CHI_sanmin_commissars:0 "Sanmin Political Commissars"
 CHI_sanmin_commissars_desc:0 "The National Revolution that we are fighting for is not just a series of military campaigns, but a social and political revolution. We must make sure that our officers make field decisions in accordance with the Three Principles of the People and our political goals. To this end, the Party has assigned political commissars to military units both for education in Sanmin ideology and to advise officers in political affairs."
 CHI_special_methods_division:0 "Special Methods Division"
 CHI_special_methods_division_desc:0 "As we liberate more and more provinces of China from the warlords and nobles it's inevitable that the resistance from those that benefited from their regimes will resist us. To overcome this, we'll train and deploy specialised commissars to deal with reactionaries behind the lines to suppress the reactionaries."
 CHI_retake_taiwan:0 "Go Forth and Reclaim Taiwan"
 CHI_retake_taiwan_desc:0 "The island of Taiwan was surrendered to Japan after the First Sino-Japanese war and has suffered under their jackboot ever since. With our positions on the mainland secured and both our army and navy built up, we're finally in a position to liberate our Taiwanese comrades from the Japanese yoke once and for all."

 CHI_1st_congress:0 "1st Repatriated Congress of The KMT"
 CHI_1st_congress_desc:0 "After a decade overseas, the Central Committee of the KMT has returned to China in triumph. Now that the initial war against the Nanjing Clique is complete, the KMT has enough breathing room to reorganise and plan its future path towards national reunification."
 CHI_1st_congress_GXC:0 "1st Repatriated Congress of The KMT"
 CHI_1st_congress_GXC_desc:0 "After the decisive defeat of the KMT in Fujian the Left Kuomintang was thought to be over for good. This changed however as Chen Mingshu managed to bring the revolution to Liangguang and prevent the fall of republicanism in China. Now that many internal issues have been put to rest, the KMT has enough breathing room to reorganise and plan its future path towards national reunification."

 CHI_revive_china:0 "Revive China Program"
 CHI_revive_china_desc:0 "Without the Nationalist Party, there will be no new China. A vast program of extensive state planning and initiatives is necessary to bring China back up to the same level as the West."
 CHI_national_RC:0 "National Reconstruction Commission"
 CHI_national_RC_desc:0 "Inspired by proposals drafted by Zhang Renjie, a centrally-directed National Reconstruction Commission should be formed by the Nationalist Government to plan a nationwide program of capital investments and standardisations. This program will involve multiple independently-scaling efforts centred around several major population areas."
 CHI_1st_industrial:0 "First Industrialisation Phase"
 CHI_1st_industrial_desc:0 "The first planned phase of industrialisation for each base region will involve expanding the infrastructural capacity and heavy industries needed for future construction."
 CHI_standard_rail_gauges:0 "Standardised Railway Gauges"
 CHI_standard_rail_gauges_desc:0 "Railway development in China has been sporadic in particular the warlord governments have intentionally chosen gauges different from those of their regional rivals to prevent any easy invasion, and foreign firms would use whatever gauge was cheapest to build tunnels and bridges for. As part of our industrial programs, we must invest time and effort into converting all our railways to the standard gauge."
 CHI_2nd_industrial:0 "Second Industrialisation Phase"
 CHI_2nd_industrial_desc:0 "The second planned phase of industrialisation for each base region involves the development of factories reliant on fine toolings, such as consumer goods and military munitions."
 CHI_natl_dockyard:0 "National Dockyard Effort"
 CHI_natl_dockyard_desc:0 "As part of our larger industrialisation plans, major ports under our control should have their capabilities for shipbuilding and repair expanded."
 CHI_academica_sinica:0 "Academica Sinica"
 CHI_academica_sinica_desc:0 "To better foster the development of our native scientific capabilities, the KMT must commit to creating and sponsoring our own academic research institutions. Long proposed but never enacted, the fully established Academica Sinica will be the centre of these efforts."
 CHI_bopomofo:0 "Bo, Po, Mo, Fo..."
 CHI_bopomofo_desc:0 "The current methods for romanising Mandarin Chinese and even teaching the Chinese script are woefully inadequate for children or the everyday person. A new standard for phonetic symbols, similar to the Hiragana syllabary created for Japanese, should be created and spread throughout our educational system to help standardise the Chinese dialects and open mass conversation with the West."
 CHI_foreign_research:0 "Foreign Research Partnerships"
 CHI_foreign_research_desc:0 "Like it or not, the Nationalist Government cannot modernise the country without working with the international scientific community. By forming research and graduate training agreements with friendly foreign powers, we can start to build up China's own scientific prowess"

 CHI_proclaim_new_republic:0 "Assert Independence from Beijing"
 CHI_proclaim_new_republic_desc:0 "Our government's independence from Beijing has been self-evident for some time. Declaring an official declaration of independence, whilst only giving us some support within our government, will show our opposition to the Qing monarchists. This act will remind the world that we are not just 'The Kuomintang' but instead the Nationalist Government and the rightful heir to the Xinhai Revolution."
 CHI_choose_capital:0 "Choose the Republican Capital"
 CHI_choose_capital_desc:0 "The Nationalist Government is secure enough that we now need to put down more permanent infrastructural roots.

 chi_dom.1.d1:0 "After a long and tension-filled voyage from Paris, the KMT's Central Committee has arrived at the newly-captured port of Wenzhou. Because of the ongoing state of chaos in southern China, this was a quiet affair with little in the form of pomp. Wang Jingwei later delivered a brief statement outside the customs office to reassure local citizens that peace in Wenzhou would be ensured.\n\nAlong with the Nationalist Government-In-Exile, a French-trained and equipped regiment of Chinese expatriates has arrived to assist in securing southern China, along with stocks of Weltkrieg-era rifles and ammunition."

Because of the ongoing state of chaos in southern China, this was a quiet affair with little in the form of pomp. With Song Qingling present, Wang Jingwei later delivered a speech outside Longyan's City Hall, congratulating the JiangFu soldiers in holding out thus far.\n\nAlong with the Nationalist Government-In-Exile, a French-trained and equipped regiment of Chinese expatriates returned via Fujian's ports in small squads.

 chi_dom.3.d:0 "Recently, Dai Chunfeng has suggested calling for more youths to participate in the revolution of Three People's Principles. The proposal of establishing the Sanqingtuan is regarded by most people as a sign of ZhongTeJu’s expansion. However, much to their surprise, it seems that Dai Chunfeng is unlikely to directly appoint a leader of the Sanqingtuan, which offers us an opportunity. Zhou Enlai proposes that the splendid Youth general\nXiao Ke is best qualified for this position due to his superior leadership skills, while Song Qingling suggests our “Big Sister” Cai Chang is the better choice, as her image as the “Tigress soldier” will make for excellent propaganda."

 chi_dom.5.t:0 "Incidents in Wenzhou"
 chi_dom.5.d:0 "Occupation plans for Wenzhou and the other A.O.G. ports have been severely lacking compared to the meticulous steps and lines of advance drawn around Xiamen. When NRA forces occupied the city of Wenzhou, spontaneous anti-foreign riots began all across the city, leading to the murders of numerous German residents and the looting of much of the city's uptown districts. To complicate matters, several smaller advance groups of Nationalist troops also participated in the looting until more disciplined units arrived to secure the area. Wenzhou is now significantly damaged from the civil unrest."
 chi_dom.5.a:0 "Another mess for our foreign secretary to sort out."

 chi_dom.6.t:0 "Tragedy in Nantong"
 chi_dom.6.d:0 "The port of Nantong had been leased by the League of Eight Provinces to the A.O.G., and its position at the mouth of the Yangzte allowed it to act as a German-exclusive alternative to the International City of Shanghai. The advancement of the NRA towards the treaty port caused mass panic and unrest among many of its residents. Widespread looting by Chinese natives combined with scorched-earth tactics by German security forces have lit up the sky above Nantong, and the ensuing fires have wiped out many of the textile factories. An exodus of ferries heading south towards Shanghai was overcrowded and unsuited to trips outside the Yangzte, leading to several of the boats capsizing with hundreds of deaths reported. Before the NRA could do anything to control the situation, it became clear that Nantong was a disaster area. Long seen as an exemplar of how Chinese cities could be modernised, Nantong has effectively been sacked."

 chi_dom.7.t:0 "Fujianers in Hangzhou"
 chi_dom.7.d:0 "Most of the National Revolutionary Army's first units were raised in Fujian Province from local peasants and the rare urban native, and few if any of these regular troops are familiar with the standard Mandarin dialect. Yesterday a group of Fujianer soldiers on leave in Hangzhou caused a scene when language difficulties and drunkenness led to a fight with local Hangzhou residents. Despite the view of China as one nation, language difficulties and the sharp contrast between rural and urban lifestyles will make stationing most units outside of their home areas difficult."

 chi_dom.8.d:0 "The Yiguandao movement may be associated with Shandong province, but adherents can be found throughout China. At the 1929 Party Congress, the Kuomintang resolved that none of its members could also belong to any charismatic spiritual movements, chief among them being the Yiguandao. With the National Revolution now fighting against the forces of the Mad Mystic Zhang Tianran, the ZhongTeJu has begun extensive counter-intelligence sweeps to purge secret Yiguandao practitioners.\n\nThe most prominent secret Millenarian revealed so far has unexpectedly been Zhou Fohai, a Minquan faction member. Zhou has resigned all his posts under duress by the Central Committee and has now been expelled from the party. His accusation and arrest have caused a scandal within the Nationalist government."

Directed by Bu Wancang and with young Chen Yunchang playing the lead, Mulan Cong Jun (Mulan Joins the Army) is a historical period drama based on the legend of Hua Mulan, who in a show of filial piety joins the army in her father's place to fight off invading nomads. Hailing traditional virtues of honour and valour, the film was an immediate success and has raised patriotic feelings throughout the country, along with an inevitable flood of popular comparisons between Hua Mulan and Soong Qingling."

 chi_dom.10.d:0 "Directed by Cai Chusheng and Zheng Junli, The Spring River Flows East is a two-part epic movie depicting the hardships of a poor working class couple in Zhejiang during the trials and tribulations of the National Revolution. Portraying the corruption that greed and power hold over the people, the movie's message has been interpreted by many as a direct attack upon the moderate parties. However, the film has been a smashing success at the box office as well as with the critics."

 chi_dom.11.d:0 "After nearly a decade in exile, we have achieved the impossible. Driven into humiliating exile, we were forced to improvise, adapt, and overcome. While our fighting methods may be unconventional for the rest of China, our prowess and skill were displayed in our glorious victory in the League War against the imperialists and reactionaries. Now that we finally have space to breathe, we can begin inspecting our army - whether or not we will focus our efforts on our vast manpower or modernize our forces will be subject to debate at an inevitable repatriated congress of the Kuomintang.

 chi_dom.18.d1:0 "The first Party Congress of the KMT ended with the Minsheng Faction keeping its leadership. After the Congress, the Right-Wing of the Minquan Faction, led by Sun Fo, blamed the Left-Wing of the Minquan Faction, under Song’s leadership, for being too lax during the struggle for the KMT leadership. This led to the long-brewing conflict between them finally breaking out. After a fallout with no resolve, Sun Fo and his followers became angry and left, then declared the establishment of the Minzu faction. It seems that as the Minsheng Faction strengthens their control of central power and the tutelage, the Minquan Faction’s chances of gaining power are growing slim."
 chi_dom.18.d2:0 "The first Party Congress of KMT ended with the Minquan Faction overtaking the Minsheng Faction as leaders of the KMT. After the Congress, the Right-Wing of the Minquan Faction, led by Sun Fo, discussed with the Left-Wing of the Minquan Faction their desire to become their own individual faction. Although Song Qingling tries to persuade them to stay in Minquan Faction, Sun Fo and his followers have decided to leave.

After bonding with him, Morris started working for the KMT, helping train troops until he was offered to become one of Sun Yat-Sens many bodyguards. He eventually got the name Two-Gun Cohen after one battle where he was nicked by a bullet and decided to always carry two guns with him.

 chi_dom.29.t:0 "The Source"
 chi_dom.29.d:0 "If the letter wasn't unsettling enough, we’ve caught the person who was the source of the letter. Even under heavy interrogation, the person was reluctant to even speak a word about the letter, which doesn't give any hope that it is a small matter.

Like last time the conversation was the same until at a certain point all members of the meeting nodded slowly. After assuring each other that they were secure they began discussing in detail the depth of the infiltration. As the discussion progressed the spy was alarmed when one officer had reportedly said that the plan will commence in less than a month.

With Dai's influence entrenched in every facet of life his coup has succeeded. "

They realised that the unstable position of the Kuomintang meant no elected leader would have the will nor the power to come out on top. Since Wang Jingwei rose up as an insurgent state we have evolved to a fully functioning democracy so it is only right that we hold elections. There are a few parties running such as the major Minsheng and Minquan but even parties like the Chinese Syndicalist Party and the Minzu are attempting to gain some support. The votes are coming through and both the Minquan and Minsheng are tied, the winner is..."

 chi_dom.41.d:0 "Chen and Soong have been subtly critical of each other since the beginning however the two are now openly discussing who should be in charge of the Kuomintang. It seems the facade of unity has been chucked out of the window and the race to become leader has begun. The comfort we can take out of this is that the other agreed to not be a threat should one of them come out on top."

 chi_dom.45.t:0 "The Toughest Decision"
 chi_dom.45.d:0 "Chen has been troubled by these refugees as he feels it was our obligation to protect them during the Fujian Government however he has also recognised the issue that we face with the large influx of crime. He has a choice between trying to broker a peace with the peasants or forcing them all back to the Fujian Zone."

 chi_dom.47.d:0 "Chen Mingshu has finally spoken on the issue of his continued presidency, whilst he isn't fully the President of the Republic he has been overseeing the peaceful transition from Federalism.

 chi_dom.49.d:0 "On the eve of the election results we await the announcement of who will lead the Ktotoo greatness. People have been highly supportive of both due to each of their positions but at the end of the day, only one will make it on top. Despite their differences, Soong walked up to Chen shaking his hands and wishing him 'Good Luck' which he reciprocated. This is most likely to show the unity of the government but some speculate they both genuinely respect each other part to play in China."

 chi_dom.50.d:0 "The results are in and with the fate of the KMT... and China in the hands of the result many are eager to hear who came out on top. People suggest Chen might have due to his determination to unite China whilst other people make a note that some party members look high upon Soong due to her relationship with the Father of China, one thing for sure is that the winner is..."

 chi_cng.4.d:0 "The KMT's party program for developing China plans that only the KMT will be allowed to exist as a full political party for the period of Political Tutelage. As a precondition of Syndicalist aid, we have made exemptions for the Chinese Syndicalist Party and several other minor urban syndicalist groups. Should the Syndicalist parties be given an exception to the ban on public recruitment in the realm of organising urban labour?"

If we bring it back we can begin to once again have a strong army which will make our victory over China all but assured. With all the put to rest we have two questions, do we either restore it as it was before or give it a modern touch as warfare has changed since the time of the expedition."

Two ideas have emerged as most prominent, with the first being the possibility of using our vast manpower as our strength. This isn't particularly unique among the armies in China, however, there is nothing wrong with using a reliable method.

Of course, Sun Yat-Sen had many amazing qualities however he seemed desperate to hold onto power, this could also be interpreted as him trying to make sure the KMT survives. Chiang Kai-Shek is up for debate as he did a lot for the military however he also oversaw the disaster of the Northern Expedition."

 chi_cng.8.d:0 "Song Qingling has been the acting governor of Fujian province and the JiangFu zone for much of the last ten years. Her administration has, through creating a form of locally-run one-party democracy, created an alternative vision for how the National Revolution can be done that opposes the top-down nature of the Wang Jingwei program. Minsheng faction members criticize the idea of the JiangFu program being expanded to all of China as being impractical, but its implementation has proven economically and militarily successful and very popular with Fujian province locals."

Not only does this shock the Committee members, but it also ignites a huge wave of dissent in our population. Although there are voices demanding the expulsion of the entirety of Liangguang Kuomintang, our leader said that Liangguang Kuomintang is still our brother in the revolution and the only reason that they refuse the support is because they don't want to increase the burden on the Central Committee."

Their patriotic story has earned them much sympathy amongst our own forces. Upon learning of the story, the Central Committee has approved the reinstatement of these two back to their previous roles, and they will be allowed to go back to the front to command if given the final go-ahead."

However, now our lines have met local conflicts have arisen with NRA and Shandong forces engaging each other.\n\nAs our goals of National Revolution are in direct conflict with [SQI.GetName] warlordry, many within the central committee believe the broadening of the war in the Five Provinces is inevitable and welcome it. Some groups within the NRA have spoken against this arguing that Zongchangs forces are superior due to Fengtian backing, still conflict with him is inevitable."

 chi_fng.2.t:0 "[CHI.GetNameDefCap] Invites us to Negotiate"
 chi_fng.2.d:0 "While we have most certainly had our differences with the Kuomintang, we must remember that we were both founded on the same basic ideals of republicanism. While this might be true, we must also keep in mind that their form of republicanism has been corrupted by syndicalist elements. However, they could prove to be a useful ally against [QIE.GetNameDefCap]. How should we reply?"
 chi_fng.2.a:0 "We will hear them out"
 chi_fng.2.b:0 "No cooperation with the syndicalists!"

 chi_fng.3.t:0 "Negotiations Break Down"
 chi_fng.3.d:0 "While we have tried our best to bring fair and reasonable options to the table, the Fengtian delegates have proven themselves to be unreasonable. Fengtian delegates today have walked out and negotiations have been stalled."
 chi_fng.3.a:0 "They aren't real republicans!"

 chi_fng.4.t:0 "Fengtian Agrees to Attend Negotiations"

 chi_fng.6.t:0 "Fate of the [QIE.GetNameDefCap]"
 chi_fng.6.d:0 "The pressing issue of these negotiations have been on what to do with [QIE.GetNameDefCap]. We have two options. We could propose that we along with Fengtian invade [QIE.GetNameDefCap] together, or we could propose that Fengtian not Intervene in an invasion into [QIE.GetNameDefCap]."
 chi_fng.6.a:0 "Propose the Kuomintang and Fengtian organise a joint invasion of [QIE.GetNameDefCap]"

 chi_fng.7.t:0 "The Kuomintang Offers an Alliance Against [QIE.GetNameDefCap]"
 chi_fng.7.d:0 "The delegates in Nanjing have proposed to us an alliance against [QIE.GetNameDefCap]. While this would almost certainly ensure the destruction of [QIE.GetNameDefCap], we may be forced to share the spoils of war with the Kuomintang."
 chi_fng.7.a:0 "The [QIE.GetNameDefCap] must fall. We will work with the Kuomintang."

 chi_fng.8.d:0 "While in Nanjing, the Kuomintang delegates have suggested to us that we keep out of an upcoming war with [QIE.GetNameDefCap]. While this is most certainly an insult to Marshal Zhang, we must remember that the Kuomintang is one of the most powerful factions in China and our refusal could very well anger them."
 chi_fng.8.a:0 "They are the strongest power in China, we accept"
 chi_fng.8.b:0 "You have to be joking"

 chi_fng.9.t:0 "Fengtian Agrees to the Plan"

 chi_fng.11.d:0 "Our friends in Fengtian have begun to mobilise against [QIE.GetNameDefCap]. The war to liberate China is at last upon us, republicanism will once again thrive in China, as per the deal we are required to join their war effort... if we want a share of the territory anyway."

 chi_fng.15.d:0 "The Kuomintang has found itself to be victorious in the struggle against the enemy. However, the time has come to split up the spoils of war with Fengtian. We could stay true to our words and split the land as agreed to, or we could just take it all. What should we do?"

 chi_fng.20.d:0 "The Kuomintang has recently contacted one of our delegates with what they claim is a chance to unite the nation. With the Republic of China proclaimed it was just a matter of time before a demand such as this was coming our way, How should we respond?"

 chi_fng.23.t:0 "Bring up the Unification Proposal"
 chi_fng.23.d:0 "The Fengtian delegates have arrived and talks have already commenced. We must propose full unification with Fengtian officially being integrated into the Republic. The chances of Zhang accepting are perhaps minimal but it is worth a try."

 chi_fng.28.t:0 "Fengtian falls"
 chi_fng.28.d:0 "We have just received news that the Fengtian government has completely given into the Kuomintang. This is a direct threat to our national security as well as our interests in Asia. The Kuomintang now controls the Fengtian region."

 chi_fng_war.8.t:0 "Returning Eastern Shanxi?"
 chi_fng_war.8.d:0 "While giving Yan Eastern Shanxi was a core part of our deal with their government, there is much debate on if we should follow our promises. If we refuse to give up Eastern Shanxi, we will most certainly have another conflict to deal with."

 chi_fng_war.11.t:0 "Shanxi has joined our government"
 chi_fng_war.11.d:0 "Shanxi has caved to our demands and has joined us. With the region under our firm control, we can look further west to securing any remaining warlords that have eluded us so far. We are one step closer to uniting China under one banner."
 chi_fng_war.11.a:0 "China is nearly whole again!"

 chi_fng_war.12.t:0 "Returning Eastern Shanxi?"

 chi_fng_war.15.t:0 "Kuomintang incurs past the southern border"
 chi_fng_war.15.d:0 "We have just received a report from our military garrisons on our border with the Kuomintang. It appears that the Kuomintang has made an incursion past their sector onto our side of the border. This lasted for only a short while until the unit seemingly realised their mistake and quickly returned to their side."
 chi_fng_war.15.a:0 "How odd..."

 chi_fng_war.16.t:0 "Kuomintang incursions increase"
 chi_fng_war.16.d:0 "According to our military command, we have received multiple reports of Kuomintang incursions past their sector of the border. At least six incursions were reported to have happened in different locations across our southern border. We have replied by increasing our garrisons to make sure the syndicalists stay on their side of the border. We should be wary."
 chi_fng_war.16.a:0 "Are they planning an invasion?"

 chi_fng_war.17.t:0 "Locals found attacking pro-Kuomintang officials"
 chi_fng_war.17.d:0 "This morning, we have received word that the people of several border towns seen violently attacking pro-Kuomintang officials in their area. There have been reports of arson and at least three people have been killed."
 chi_fng_war.17.a:0 "Troubling"

 chi_fng_war.18.t:0 "Beiyang official killed!"
 chi_fng_war.18.d:0 "The news of a Beiyang official's death has spread quickly throughout the government. After failing to show up to a conference, he was found dead in his kitchen. While the cause of death has not been confirmed, many in the government are growing increasingly paranoid."
 chi_fng_war.18.a:0 "A Kuomintang assassin perhaps?"

 chi_fng_war.19.t:0 "The Red Scare spreading unrest throughout the north"
 chi_fng_war.19.d:0 "Many protests started seemingly overnight as people took to the streets to burn red flags and chant 'Death to the Reds' and 'Save our Families'. The stories are well known. The people are no fools and are aware of what has been happening. Every day, stories come in from our southern border. Mass executions, confiscation of land, families murdered. The people have seen what these bloodthirsty syndicalists have done to the land and will never allow such a thing to happen here."
 chi_fng_war.19.a:0 "Something needs to be done before this gets out of hand"

 chi_fng_war.20.t:0 "Explosion in Beijing"
 chi_fng_war.20.d:0 "It has just been reported that there has been a massive explosion at an industrial plant in Beijing. It happened seemingly out of nowhere and when authorities arrived at the scene, the building was completely destroyed. At this moment, the death toll appears to be around thirty-four. An investigation is being held to find out who was behind this, but as of now, the people are frightened."
 chi_fng_war.20.a:0 "This has to be the work of the Kuomintang"

 chi_fng_war.21.t:0 "The Marshal's decision"
 chi_fng_war.21.d:0 "After learning of the explosion, Marshal Zhang ordered a meeting of his highest generals and staff to discuss possible actions. As of now, there is much evidence that the Kuomintang was behind the attack. This, in every definition, is a declaration of war by the Kuomintang. What does Marshal Zhang decide to do? "
 chi_fng_war.21.a:0 "The Kuomintang behind this, they must pay!"
 chi_fng_war.21.b:0 "This is just fear-mongering, send the military down to quell the unrest"

 chi_fng_war.22.t:0 "Fengtian issue a declaration of war"
 chi_fng_war.22.d:0 "This evening, the Fengtian government issued us a formal declaration of war. In the declaration, they claimed that after multiple border incursions, the murder of Fengtian officials, and the aiding of terrorism, they have no other choice but to issue a declaration of war."

 CHI_military_expeditions_category:0 "The Chinese National Revolution"
 CHI_military_expeditions_category_desc:0 "After the disastrous failure of the Northern Expedition, the Kuomintang's internal unity literally and figuratively split along ideological lines. While the subordinate right-wing faction found refuge with the southern warlords, the Left KMT was reduced to an insurgency in south-east China and a government-in-exile in Paris. The last ten years have seen few openings to re-establish a rival government, but the consensus is that the next attempt must fully embrace social revolution.
