### Leaders ###
 POLITICS_HIROHITO_DESC:0 "Assuming the Chrysanthemum throne after the death of his father, Emperor Taishō, His Imperial Majesty represents a divine dynasty of nearly 2,500 years; his personage is seen not only as head of state, but as representative of the very heart, soul, and being of the nation. As both militarists and a resurgent left thrive amidst mounting domestic chaos, the Emperor remains silent, his role unclear and undecided. However, when and if the Emperor does make his move, it will no doubt be decisive."
 POLITICS_ARAHATA_KANSON_DESC:0 "The first Chairman of the Japanese Union, Arahata Kanson, took office during the immediate change in the political landscape of the nation. Having been arrested in the Red Flag Incident, Arahata had to hide his pro-socialist tendencies, later creating a socialist underground for left-leaning activists. It is said Arahata might be responsible for all the radical left violence against the Imperial regime."

 JAP_army_mob_description_mass:0 "What we need now is speed, something faster than normal leg infantry. The high command is pushing for us to invest in trucks transporting troops. However, our industrial capacity is still limited, so in some cases we will need to improvise and adopt other methods. One method could be using bicycles, that will temporarily replace trucks until we will be able to fully mechanise our army."

 JAP_army_mob_title_tech:0 "Advanced Motorised Designs"
 JAP_army_mob_description_tech:0 "Speed is crucial to winning modern battles, whether that comes in the form of redeployments or exploiting breakthroughs. We must foster the expansion of motorised IJA units in order to bring such advances to Japan."

 JAP_army_mob_title_default:0 "Mobility Advances"
 JAP_army_mob_description_default:0 "The cavalry charges of the Weltkrieg were probably the last. The truck is no longer just a transport tool and rapidly integrates to mobile warfare tactics.

 JAP_army_tank_description_air:0 "Our infantrymen, despite being the most skilled in the world, are still without protection against machine guns. In order to solve that, we shall allocate more funds for the research and development of a new weapon: armoured vehicles called tanks.

 JAP_army_tank_description_mass:0 "Tanks are massive beasts made out of steel that can crush everything they will face, but they have a problem, a massive one: they are incredibly expensive to produce. If we want to be able to use them, we will need to cut corners wherever possible, otherwise we won’t be able to produce enough of them to win any war. This might affect their reliability, but we need numbers."

 JAP_army_tank_title_tech:0 "Breakthrough Tank Designs"
 JAP_army_tank_description_tech:0 "While some would argue that given our likely enemies and the terrain of Asia and the Pacific, tanks are a costly white elephant, the reality is that these new vehicles have the potential to transform warfare, and we must ride the crest of this wave."

 JAP_army_sup_description_mass:0 "Numbers are the key to victory, and that means also preserving them. We will need the help of the Nippon Sekijūjisha, the Japanese Red Cross Society, which has helped the Imperial Japanese Army both in the Russo-Japanese war and in the Weltkrieg in assisting wounded soldiers. Due to how huge the number of soldiers in the field is, they require more equipment than we currently have, even if that means using second-hand materials to provide them with what they need."

 JAP_army_specop_description_mass:0 "The Kaigun Tokubetsu Rikusentai, or Rikusentai for short, are infantry units of the Imperial Japanese Navy specialised in naval landings. Considering we will have to fight in China, which has a massive coastline, in the Insulindian archipelago and in the Pacific islands, we will need to expand their recruitment base and improve their training facilities if we want to maintain the naval supremacy we currently have in East Asia."

 JAP_army_specop_description_default:0 "Special Forces are more than the Elite Units of old. With modern equipment, even a conscript can hold his own on the battlefield.

 JAP_army_landdoc_description_will:0 "The modern Japanese curriculum, designed to counter Russian aggression on the plains of Manchuria, emphasises morale factors, tenacity of will and stressing training designed to develop the ability to recognise opportunities for decisive attack by enveloping open enemy flanks, encircling formations, and thus destroying even numerically and technologically superior forces."

 JAP_army_landdoc_title_mass:0 "Grand Assaults"
 JAP_army_landdoc_description_mass:0 "In East Asia, there are two things nobody has besides us: automatic weapons and good infrastructure. Thus, we have decided that grand assaults will be enough to win land battles, but we will need to pay attention to not have our army being in situations when they will be short on supplies, otherwise we might find ourselves in difficult situations."

 JAP_army_landdoc_title_tech:0 "Theoretical Land Doctrine"
 JAP_army_landdoc_description_tech:0 "While strategy has traditionally focused on the study of past conflicts, we should always remember that these examples were so important because they were novel. We must remind our commanders that they are not trying to redo the past, but tread new paths."

 JAP_army_landdoc_title_default:0 "Land Doctrine Advances"
 JAP_army_landdoc_description_default:0 "The Weltkrieg, from its start to its end, changed warfare forever by finally ending Napoleonic Warfare's grasp on military thought and confirming the extreme deadliness of the rifle, machine gun and artillery cannon. Our army must adapt or perish, in a literal sense."

 JAP_army_airdoc_title_air:0 "Air Battle"
 JAP_army_airdoc_description_air:0 "Unlike land warfare, air warfare is almost entirely a novelty – and that means we need to build our air doctrines from zero, and solve the problem about how we can fly with night or rain. If we achieve this, however, we will make sure our air force are never going to give our army up, and never going to let it down."

 JAP_army_airdoc_title_tech:0 "Air Extension Initiative"
 JAP_army_airdoc_description_tech:0 "The lands we must patrol are vast, likely far from any airfields. Rather than looking at any specific air tactics, we must instead focus on ensuring that our planes can actually reach anywhere they are needed, to assist our operations whenever necessary."

 JAP_army_airdoc_title_default:0 "Air Doctrine Advances"

 JAP_army_inf_description_air:0 "On the western front of the Weltkrieg, the French taught everyone an important lesson: you need camouflage uniforms, otherwise the enemy is going to spot you easily.

The Imperial Japanese Army is a force of will, of the people, of the state, and of the Emperor."

 JAP_army_inf_title_mass:0 "Rifle Production Standards"
 JAP_army_inf_description_mass:0 "The islands of Japan suffers significantly from a lack of important war materials causing a severe shortage of almost every type of equipment for our men.

 JAP_army_inf_title_tech:0 "State-of-the-Art Equipment"
 JAP_army_inf_description_tech:0 "When Japan modernised herself, she quickly learned that having better equipment than her enemies was a major ace in combat. Now that we are a modern nation ourselves, we must preserve our weaponry advantage at all costs to retain this edge in combat."

 JAP_army_inf_title_default:0 "Infantry Equipment Advances"
 JAP_army_inf_description_default:0 "For a long time, military breakthroughs were slow, and having a good bolt-action rifle was enough. However, these rifles of the 19th Century are completely out of place on a post-Weltkrieg battlefield. We must stop being complacent and get new equipment."

 JAP_army_big_title_air:0 "Multicoloured Shell Tracers"
 JAP_army_big_description_air:0 "Coloured shell tracers will be a key point in reforming our army: by differentiating different types of shells with different colours, our air force will be able to execute support manoeuvres, be it ground support or air superiority, which will help turn our army into an unstoppable force that can’t be matched by anything on Earth."

 JAP_army_big_description_mass:0 "Just like our rifles, our artillery needs to be produced en masse, and the Osaka Army Arsenal, the oldest arsenal in Japan, approached us with a new design that will help us to streamline its production.

 JAP_army_big_title_tech:0 "Unparalleled Artillery"
 JAP_army_big_description_tech:0 "Artillery is one of the great deciders of combat, with the side able to hit their targets with the greatest range and accuracy being almost unstoppable. We will use this advantage to keep our enemies hiding in their holes, as our gunners tune their range."

 JAP_army_fighter_description_mass:0 "Currently, more than one designer produces our fighters causing a wide variety of models of the same type of plane. By issuing an act that forces all the manufacturers to standardise their planes based on an uniform design, we will make sure the production will be streamlined, and our fighters will be ready to be mass produced. It’s said that this design is unreliable, but those voices will quickly go away after some testing."

 JAP_army_fighter_title_tech:0 "Progressive Aircraft Designs"
 JAP_army_fighter_description_tech:0 "As the field of aerial combat evolves, it is obvious to many that fighters designed for different combat notions are not fit for the purpose. We will therefore begin creating aircraft which have adapted and evolved for changing tactics."

 JAP_army_fighter_title_default:0 "Fighter Advances"
 JAP_army_fighter_description_default:0 "The dogfights of the Weltkrieg were merely the start of air-to-air warfare. As planes become faster, more armoured and more heavily armed, we need to put all our efforts into making sure we control the air. Then, striking the ground is a formality."

 JAP_army_bomb_title_air:0 "Fire Bombing Doctrine"
 JAP_army_bomb_description_air:0 "Our bombers will need to destroy the enemy’s supply lines, and the high command came up with an interesting idea: considering that most cities and infrastructures in Asia are made out of wood, using fire bombs for our bombers would be extremely effective. Some may consider it inhuman or excessive, but we will do what needs to be done to destroy both the western imperialists and the syndicalists."

 JAP_army_bomb_title_will:0 "Strike Terror"

 JAP_army_bomb_description_mass:0 "Just like our fighters, our bombers vary wildly in their designs. We will issue an act similar to what we did to our fighter aircraft forcing a standardisation of designs. There may also be reliability issues, but surely our enemies won’t notice, especially when they see thousands of bombers over their heads ready to drop bombs."

 JAP_army_bomb_title_tech:0 "Next Generation Bomber Aircraft"
 JAP_army_bomb_description_tech:0 "Current bomber aircraft are outdated and slow, but proponents of aerial bombardment argue that designing new bombers could finally allow them to achieve their dream of beating an enemy without ever sending ground forces against them."

 JAP_army_bomb_title_default:0 "Bomber Advances"
 JAP_army_bomb_description_default:0 "Even when they were brand new, bombers inspired fear, and many saw their potential.

### Events ###

 japdom.1.t:0 "Recovering from the Lost Decade"
 japdom.1.d:0 "In what has come to be called the 'Lost Decade', the 1920s were marked by economic depression and political instability in Japan. The plight was particularly severe in the agricultural sector and caused a massive demographic change, as farmers fled from the depressed countryside to urban areas, flooding the labour market, and further driving down wages.\n\nAfter leaving the Kenseikai-led 'Constitutionalist Coalition' and taking charge of the Government, Inukai and his cabinet successfully expanded the Japanese sphere of influence into Manchuria and the edges of Siberia, acquiring a vital export market for the Japanese economy, but the agricultural situation continued to deteriorate as cheap agricultural imports from Manchuria bled into the countryside. As 1936 dawns, continued rearmament and state investment have fully rebuilt the industrial economy, but the issue of rural poverty remains chronic and unsolved."
 japdom.1.a:0 "Gaman shiyou."

 japdom.2.t:0 "Dissolution of the Diet"
 japdom.2.d:0 "The four-year term of the incumbent Imperial Diet elected in 1932 is ending. Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi has called for a general election to happen as soon as possible."
 japdom.2.a:0 "Very well."

 japdom.3.t:0 "General Election 1936"
 japdom.3.d:0 "After the Constitutional Restoration of 1926, and subsequent political realignment, two parties came to dominate Japanese politics: the conservative Rikken Seiyūkai (Association of Friends of Constitutional Government) and the liberal Minseito (Democratic Party).\n\nThe Rikken Seiyūkai has an absolute majority from the general election of 1932, but support in the countryside (their traditional voting base) has been declining. As the political atmosphere turned against the ruling party, the Minseito, known as the Kenseikai (Constitutional Government Association) before 1927, solidified its electoral base throughout the cities and began to expand into the countryside, hoping to break the Seiyūkai's absolute majority in the Diet. A new, third player in the general election of 1936 is the Shakai Taishuto (Socialist Masses Party), founded by social democrats and syndicalists in 1933.\n\nIt is now time to see if the Seiyūkai have retained enough seats to keep an absolute majority..."
 japdom.3.a:0 "The Seiyūkai have defended their absolute majority!"
 japdom.3.b:0 "The Seiyūkai have lost their absolute majority!"

 japdom.4.t:0 "The Assassination of Katayama Sen"
 japdom.4.d:0 "Born in 1859, Katayama Sen was one of the most senior syndicalist leaders in Japan, known as the 'father of Japanese syndicalism'. Exiled to the USA after participating in the early social democratic movement, Katayama witnessed and was influenced by Jack Reed's syndicalist activities and the development of the IWW into the CSA. Katayama returned to Japan after the Constitutional Restoration of 1926 and founded the first legal syndicalist party in Japan, the Rōdō-Nōmintō (Labour-Farmer Party), and after the party was declared illegal in 1932, he formed another party called the Shakai Taishuto (Socialist Masses Party), an amalgamation of social democratic parties and syndicalist movements.\n\nYesterday, while visiting Kyoto to congratulate Taishuto member Yamamoto Senji on his election, a gang of three right-wingers stormed his office and beat the two men with clubs. Yamamoto survived, but Katayama, aged 75, never regained consciousness and died earlier today."
 japdom.4.a:0 "This will be bad..."

 japdom.5.t:0 "Friction Within the Japanese Left"
 japdom.5.d:0 "The shock of the assassination of Katayama Sen initially united the Shakai Taishuto in solidarity against the "white terror", but the unity did not last long. The party was originally structured as a coalition of various social democrat and syndicalist organisations, only united in the goal of 'socialisation of the economic structure with the proletariat at its foundation'. Before his death, Katayama had guided the party away from ideological clashes, but deprived of its leader the party was forced to face the question of its precise ideological position, and infighting soon began.\n\nThroughout the spring of 1936, national-syndicalists, called the Nichirōkei (Japan-Labour Clique), adopted Totalism and vigorously expanded its membership, not only inside the party, at the expense of the moderate Shaminkei, (Social Democratic Clique) but also from outside the party, notably from the Shaminkei-controlled Nihon Rodo Sōdōmei (Japan General Federation of Labour). Soon, an open fight between the two groups broke out. The Nichirōkei accused the Sōdōmei of being run by 'the labour bureaucrat establishment', and in turn the Sōdōmei and the Shaminkei accused the Nichirōkei of hijacking and turning labour organisations into their puppets. The Nichirōkei's members were expelled from both the Sōdōmei and the Taishuto earlier this month, and the group is now operating independently."
 japdom.5.a:0 "An interesting development."

 japdom.6.t:0 "The May 15th Incident"
 japdom.6.d:0 "The Prime Minister has been assassinated! Radical officers connected to the Nichirōkei broke into his official residence and shot Prime Minister Inukai. They claim they did so to avenge the death of Katayama Sen and the murder of workers in Niigata. The incident has greatly shocked the nation, and the Admiralty Board, mortified by the incident, has already begun a court martial and a deep investigation into radical activities within the Navy."
 japdom.6.a:0 "Appoint Suzuki Kisaburō to replace Inukai."

 japdom.7.t:0 "Restorationists and Centralists"
 japdom.7.d:0 "The 'Ishinha', restoration faction is a political ideology promoted by radical junior officers, characterised by its anti-capitalism, anti-oligarchism and anti-parliamentarism. Usually coming from underprivileged and/or humble backgrounds, many of these officers have experienced poverty from childhood and observed what they considered to be the evil influence of favouritism, leading them to believe that the establishment has hijacked power from the Emperor and is leading the nation into the abyss. The Restorationist solution was to sweep out the ruling establishment and restore all power back to the Emperor, and from there a complete national reform was to be initiated. Against them are the 'Chūshinha', the central faction, who are close to the central military leadership who support cooperation with the establishment, and the militarisation of politics."
 japdom.7.a:0 "This will be trouble..."

 japdom.8.t:0 "The Security Debate"
 japdom.8.d:0 "The debate in the Imperial Diet has steadily increased the last few months, and is now reaching a terrifying level. Many members fear for their lives, and so, progress isn't just a matter of political power or personal pride, but of survival. There is a growing consensus that the current security laws aren't enough to protect democracy and that more are needed. The May 15th Incident must not be allowed to happen again."
 japdom.8.a:0 "A comprehensive law, an act, must be made!"

 japdom.9.t:0 "The National Security Act"
 japdom.9.d:0 "The notorious Peace Preservation Act was introduced in early 1924 by the Tanaka regime amidst the red scare following the Kantō anarchist uprising in September 1923, and a syndicalist assassination attempt on then-Crown Prince Hirohito in December of the same year. The Act drastically limited civil rights and symbolised the draconian rule of General Tanaka. It was repealed when the regime was brought down by the Constitutional Restoration of 1926, but Prime Minister Suzuki Kisaburō now wants to reintroduce the Act, albeit heavily moderated and renamed the 'National Security Act'. He has met strong opposition, even within his own cabinet, and public opinion has dropped to a new low, but Suzuki believes its reintroduction is a necessary step to counter the rising tide of syndicalism, and he is not alone in his opinion. A cross-party parliamentary group led by Nakajima Chikuhei of the Rikken Seiyūkai and Adachi Kenzō of the Minseito have declared the Act as the 'last bulwark of constitutional government' and support its passage. The House of Peers and the Privy Council are also in favour of the Act."
 japdom.9.a:0 "We must defend our Democracy by any means necessary; the Act is forced through."
 japdom.9.b:0 "Public opinion and the opposition defeat the Act."

 japdom.10.t:0 "The Trial of the May 15th Incident"
 japdom.10.d:0 "The court martial of the eleven murderers of Prime Minister Inukai began last month. Before the end of their trial a petition arrived at court, containing over 350,000 signatures in blood from sympathisers around the country, pleading for a lenient sentence. In addition to the petition, the court also received a request from eleven youths in Niigata, asking that they be executed in place of the Navy officers, and sending eleven severed fingers to the court as a gesture of their sincerity! The whole trial was unpopular enough to convince the court to accelerate the process, and although the death sentences were issued just yesterday, the assassins were executed at dawn today."
 japdom.10.a:0 "This country is going crazy..."

 japdom.11.t:0 "The Assassination of Suzuki Kisaburō"
 japdom.11.d:0 "The unthinkable has happened again! Prime Minister Suzuki and his brother-in-law Hatoyama Ichirō were attending a party rally in Kawagoe today. When Hatoyama stood up to deliver his speech, a syndicalist terrorist from the 'Saitama Youth Volunteer Corps for National Salvation', shot Suzuki and Hatoyama in retaliation for the execution of Prime Minister Inukai's assassins. Suzuki's wound has proven fatal."
 japdom.11.a:0 "Gomeifuku wo inorimasu."

 japdom.12.t:0 "Government under Fire"
 japdom.12.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the failure to pass the National Security Act has created a backlash against the Prime Minister. The conservatives and bureaucrats who had backed the bill feel betrayed by Suzuki's back-down. The House of Peers and the Privy Council, disappointed by the Government's inability to produce any measures against syndicalism, have lost all their patience with the cabinet."
 japdom.12.a:0 "Suzuki's days are numbered..."

 japdom.13.t:0 "Resignation of Suzuki Kisaburō"
 japdom.13.d:0 "Abandoned by everyone, the humiliated Prime Minister resigned when the Peers passed a censure motion denouncing the cabinet and, with lukewarm support, former Home Minister Mizuno Rentarō was appointed in his place. Ominously, the Privy Council and its ultraconservative chairman Baron Hiranuma released a statement declaring that the 'parliamentary impotency' needs to be replaced by a more stable system."
 japdom.13.a:0 "Call emergency convention!"

 japdom.14.t:0 "The Election of Mizuno Rentarō"
 japdom.14.dead:0 "The death of Suzuki stunned the Rikken Seiyūkai and an emergency convention was called. The bureaucratic Tokonami faction (named after Tokonami Takejirō (1867-1935), chairman of the pro-Tanaka Seiyū Hontō during the Tanaka dictatorship and its aftermath) has been crippled by the loss of their leader, leaving the reactionary Nakajima faction to take control of the party. From his new post as Director of General Affairs, Nakajima enjoys decision-making power over the entire party, though he has stopped short of crowning himself chairman, and appointed current Prime Minister and Tokonami-aligned Mizuno Rentarō instead."

 japdom.15.t:0 "Japan's Longest Winter"
 japdom.15.d:0 "The Japanese government has found itself effectively paralysed. The downfall of two successive Seiyūkai Prime Ministers has severely weakened the power of the new Prime Minister, and Hiranuma's open scheme to destroy the parliamentary system has only worsened the political turmoil. Extremist groups are growing by the day, and the military is getting more and more frustrated. Several high-ranking officers within the Army have hatched a plot to overthrow the civilian administration and 'rescue' the Empire. The plotters have approached Army Minister Hayashi Senjuro for his support..."
 japdom.15.a:0 "The future of Japan lies in his choice."

 japdom.16.t:0 "Japan's Longest Day"
 japdom.16.d:0 "After ten years of political disgrace, the army has taken power again, this time by a coup d'état. Ultraconservative politician Baron Hiranuma Kiichirō is now Prime Minister, and a state of martial law has been enacted across all of the Greater Japanese Empire."
 japdom.16.a:0 "Banzai!"

 japdom.17.t:0 "Failed Coup Attempt"
 japdom.17.d:0 "Even through the Army Minister refused to support the coup, he made no effort to stop the plot. The plotters interpreted this as a signal of permission, and proceeded. This morning, the coup forces seized the Metropolitan Police Headquarters, the Prime Minister's Residence, and the new Imperial Diet Building, but failed to occupy the Imperial Palace. To the surprise of the plotters, the Emperor resisted the coup d'état and issued an imperial command to suppress the rebels, sealing their fate. The coup forces surrendered without resistance and key conspirators were quickly caught, while some took their own lives before they could be arrested."
 japdom.17.a:0 "Democracy has prevailed!"

 japdom.18.t:0 "The Power Struggle"
 japdom.18.d:0 "Restorationist officers were the main participants of the coup that overthrew the elected government, for they saw the parliamentary system as a plutocratic capitalist institution. Under the successive government however, the Centralists took the leading role in the new regime and the Restorationists were marginalised from the leadership. The Restorationist leadership has concluded that they were deceived. A new power struggle has begun."
 japdom.18.a:0 "Will this ever end?"

 japdom.19.t:0 "The Ishinha Counter-Coup"
 japdom.19.d:0 "Earlier today, Restorationist junior officers from units in the Tokyo area have staged a new coup d'état! In the early morning, 1,400 officers and enlisted soldiers embarked on missions to seize control of key communications and administrative facilities. The Army Ministry, the General Staff Office, the Metropolitan Police Headquarters, the Prime Minister's Official Residence, and the Imperial Diet Building were all quickly captured, and the Imperial Palace went under siege. In the afternoon, the emperor himself addressed the soldiers announcing his official support of their revolution."
 japdom.19.a:0 "The coup is successful!"

 japdom.20.t:0 "Restorationist Coup Attempt!"
 japdom.20.d:0 "Earlier today Restorationist junior officers from units in the Tokyo area have staged a new coup d'état! In the early morning, 1,400 officers and enlisted soldiers embarked on missions to seize control of key communications and administrative facilities. The Army Ministry, the General Staff Office, the Metropolitan Police Headquarters, the Prime Minister's Official Residence, and the Imperial Diet Building were all quickly captured, and the Imperial Palace went under siege. After the emperor explicitly denounced the putschists the navy mobilised marine divisions to rescue the palace, and by the evening the coup was crushed."
 japdom.20.a:0 "Thank god for the navy!"

 japdom.21.t:0 "The Centralists Win!"
 japdom.21.d:0 "The Restorationist coup has been defeated. Branded traitors, the Restorationists are being purged all over the country. There are calls for the Army to assume a greater role in government to help root out both the traitors and the syndicalists."
 japdom.21.a:0 "Army Minister Hayashi will assume the premiership."
 japdom.21.b:0 "There is no need for this right now."

 japdom.22.t:0 "The Government of National Unity"
 japdom.22.d:0 "Nakajima Chikuhei from the Rikken Seiyūkai and Adachi Kenzō from the Minseito, both supporters of the National Security Act, have issued a joint statement, urging both the mainstream parties to form a multi-party 'Government of National Unity' to protect the Kokutai (national polity) from the syndicalist threat."

 japdom.22.b:0 "We don't need your nonsense; an election is what we need!"

 japdom.23.t:0 "On the Basic Principles of National Defence"
 japdom.23.d:0 "After taking power, the Centralists sought a political blueprint for their new regime. They have presented such a blueprint, titled 'On the Basic Principles of National Defence' and have distributed it among the Centralist leadership. Envisioning an 'Advanced National Defence State' (Kōdō Kokubō Kokka), the document proposes to transform the state into one geared and ready for total war. To this end, not only must Japan's economic structure be reorganised along a militarist line, but the Japanese people must be 'ideologically enlightened' to abandon self-interest. They must abandon class struggle, which is harmful to national security, and restructure society along a moral economic line."
 japdom.23.a:0 "This is the way we should go forward."

 japdom.24.t:0 "On The Fundamental Principles of the National Structure"
 japdom.24.d:0 "'On The Fundamental Principles of the National Structure' is a 156 page pamphlet produced by the Ministry of Education to establish an official description of the 'Kokutai', or national structure (It can also can be translated as 'national essence', 'national polity', etc). The pamphlet officially enshrines the Emperor as a living god, according to the legend of the Goddess Amaterasu and 'an unbroken line of emperors' (Banseiikkei). To serve the divine Emperor, his subjects were required to cast themselves aside for the social harmony (Wa) and for the prosperity of Japanese culture. To some extent, the pamphlet is a response to criticism of the Centralist's 'Neo-Shogunism'."

 japdom.25.t:0 "The New System Movement"
 japdom.25.d:0 "To mobilise support for the regime and its reform programme, the 'New System Movement' (Shintaisei Undō) has been organised. Led by Prince Konoe Fumimarō, the movement aims for the creation of a political institution that is capable of merging and binding people into the organic whole of the nation - basically a Japanese breed of corporatism, with the Emperor at its head. The movement's immediate goal is the combination of all political perspectives into one party- the Imperial Rule Assistance Society (Taisei Yokusankai)."
 japdom.25.a:0 "This is the way we should go forward."

 japdom.26.t:0 "The First Convention of the Taisei Yokusankai"
 japdom.26.d:0 "The Taisei Yokusankai, or Imperial Rule Assistance Society, is structured as a new political core institution that will represent every aspect of society, unlike the old 'plutocratic' Imperial Diet. It will branch out into every administrative level from hamlet to prefecture, and create a core group consisting of talented individuals from academic, cultural, economic, governmental, military, political, and all other professional occupations. In theory, by penetrating to the grass-roots level, a direct link between politics and the people will be established. By having every important interest group represented at its core, it would be possible to coordinate and develop effective national policies. Sadly, that vision has already collapsed, as the various movements the Taisei Yokusankai was meant to bind together have already begun to argue and compete for control of the society.\n\nThree main groups have emerged at the convention. The leading group is the Kakushinha (Reformist Faction) headed by none other than Prince Konoe himself, composed of reform-minded intellectuals and politicians. The second group is the Kōdōha (Imperial Way Faction), named after General Araki's frequent usage of the word 'Imperial Way', or 'Kōdō', composed of reserve or active Restorationist military leaders. Third is the Yokuseiha, mainly composed of former parliamentary politicians who sympathised with the Restorationist cause. The name 'Yokuseiha' originated from an abbreviation of a political association of Restorationist sympathisers, the Yokusan Seijikai (Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association).\n\nThe latter two object to the Kakushinha's forceful agenda, and even question the purpose of the Taisei Yokusankai. Konoe had designed the Taisei Yokusankai as a central nervous system of the upcoming 'New System', combining all legislative, executive and administrative powers into one. Konoe assured that the old Meiji Constitution would remain as it is and the Taisei Yokusankai would not replace the Imperial Diet, but the very idea of the political leviathan has met with vigorous opposition."

One such agreement was that the powerful post of the Secretary-General would remain vacant (but not abolished), with its tasks transferred to the collective leadership of the General Council.\n\nLast month, believing he had solidified his position, Nakajima attempted to complete his domination by capturing the office of Secretary-General. To this end, he formally advised the General Council to return the post to former Secretary-General Kuhara Fusanosuke, who sympathised with the Reformists, and on April 28th Nakajima and his clique formed the 'Kakushin Dōmei' (Reformist Alliance), effectively a party within a party, pressing the General Council even further. After the general election had concluded, on May 14th the pro-Nakajima chairman of the General Council Horikiri Zenbe forced the issue to a vote within the Council, but the motion was vetoed by all other factions. Isolated within the upper echelons, the Reformists tried to overcome the situation by calling a convention to mobilise their local party cadres, but this was turned down by all other non-Reformist leaders again, frustrating Nakajima even more. Today, just a month after the election, the Kakushin Dōmei formally declared its independence from the Rikken Seiyūkai."

He calls for expanding our mobilisation capability, modernising equipment, and centralising the command structure.\n\nGeneral Obata's analysis is nearly identical, but he has come to a different conclusion; due to volatile international tensions, war would come to Japan before the country could ever achieve such a capacity through internal development. Accordingly, he came to the conclusion that in future wars, the IJA must seek the quick destruction of hostile forces by waging war through short, rapid, and decisive operations, to avoid a long war.\n\nBoth agree a centralised command structure is a good idea, and that raw manpower tactics are a poor strategy; we can never hope to compete with Russian or Chinese manpower.

 japfor.45.d:0 "A Japanese diplomat arrived today, seeking a meeting with [Root.GetLeader] to discuss their offer: [From.GetNameDef] will send military aid and advisers to [PRF.GetNameDef], and in exchange we will join the Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. Not the military alliance part of it, at least not yet, but rather the group of nations which have pooled their economic strengths under the aegis of Japanese protection. It would benefit the [Root.GetAdjective] economy, to be certain, but there are those who worry the Japanese are merely looking for influence to eventually turn us into a colony."
 japfor.45.a:0 "We accept their offer."
 japfor.45.b:0 "We must politely decline."

 japfor.46.t:0 "The Indians Accept!"
 japfor.46.d:0 "Our generous offer to the Indians was met with warm praise and acceptance. Envoys from [From.GetNameDef] applauded Japanese magnanimity and astute work in bringing our great nations closer together. We have invited them to set up a permanent embassy in Tokyo."
 japfor.46.a:0 "Splendid!"

 japfor.47.t:0 "The Indians Decline Our Offer!"
 japfor.47.d:0 "In a display of poor judgement, the diplomats in [From.GetNameDef] have declined our magnanimous offer of friendship and alliance.

With momentum on their side, our garrison forces collapsed to a mixture of defections and confusion. Worse still, it seems our communication lines were manned by less than loyal men leaving us unable to mount a swift counter attack.\n\nAfter several emergency meetings, the Emperor has decided to given them three days to stand down.

He says that he hopes America will cooperate in the best interests of peace across the ocean, and invites us to send representatives to ensure a peaceful transition of power.This blatant power-grab has not gone unnoticed, but with America's current turmoil our leading officers question the Honolulu garrison's ability to hold of the invasion force. Hawks in cabinet insist the civil war will be short and that our men can hold out until reinforcements arrive. And that the Japanese would likely back down in face of American confidence. Others have called for calm, and are hoping to persuade [Root.GetLeader] to hold off on revenge till after America is stabilized.

A delegation has been sent to meet with American officials in Honolulu to secure a peaceful transfer of power and our troops landed without a shot fired.

However, some in our government have quietly wondered if this is a step too far. What if we've overstretched? And what if the Americans come back for revenge? There's no time for that defeatism now however, Japan is on the move and we will carve out our destiny in Asia!"

 japfor.318.t:0 "America Defiant!"
 japfor.318.d:0 "An escalating crisis in the pacific! Despite the chaos engulfing North America, their stubborn government has refused to loosen their grip on the Pacific, promising harsh retaliation for any attempt to violate their sovereignty. This arrogant, greedy attitude could only be expected of these colonizers, but it leaves us in a bind. While there is no doubt that we can seize these islands by force, some have questioned the ability of our navy to hold on to these islands for more than a few years. The United States is a force to be reckoned with, called a sleeping giant by some. But others say the Japanese spirit has always been about defying odds, whether it be bringing the Chinese dragon to heel in 1895 or banishing the Russians from Manchuria in 1905. To lose face even while the Americans are at their weakest would be tantamount to surrender, forever consigning the Japanese people to a secondary role in the Pacific. This is it then, Japan is at a crossroads - what will the land of the rising sun choose to do next?"

 japfor.401.d.conf:0 "At the Tokyo Conference, Japanese officials brought up the notion of deeper economic ties between their nation and ours. Now they have approached the [Root.GetAdjective] government, presenting their offer to admit us into what they consider the economic part of their 'Co-Prosperity Sphere'. They say that we are free to join or refuse, as we desire."
 japfor.401.d.noconf:0 "The Japanese government has approached us with an offer to join the economic part of their 'Greater Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere'. With it, we would relax the rules for Japanese investment in [Root.GetNameDef], and bring with that investment a degree of prosperity and independence from 'Western Imperialism'. Some say, however, that this would simply be exchanging Western Imperialism for Japanese Imperialism, and that we should beware opening a box we may not be able to close again."

 japfor.405.d:0 "With active encouragement by the [From.GetAdjective] government, investors from [From.GetNameDef] have been arriving in [Root.GetNameDef] in droves. Their presence will have some benefits, it's true, but there is a growing fear that this domination by the [From.GetAdjective] economy will ultimately see us beholden to the [From.GetAdjective] government... if we are not already."

 japfor.407.d:0 "If there were concerns about Japan's continued investment in [Root.GetNameDef] leading to their domination, they can be set aside - it has already come to pass. [Root.GetAdjective] policy is already routinely made to please Japanese interests, and any thoughts we had of our independence have slowly become a polite fiction. The arrival of several 'advisers' from [From.GetNameDef] has laid to rest any idea that we may act as we wish within the Co-Prosperity Sphere."
 japfor.407.a:0 "So be it"

 japfor.408.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Ends Alliance"

 japfor.409.a:0 "How foolish."

 japfor.410.t:0 "[From.GetAdjective] Investments Nationalised"
 japfor.410.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has taken the drastic step of forcibly nationalising the investments we've made into [From.GetNameDef], also withdrawing their place in the Co-Prosperity Sphere in the process. Perhaps they worried about the prospect of Japanese control over their economy? If so, they have handed us the excuse to invade - if we desire to take them up on their provocation."

 japfor.422.a:0 "Great news!"

 japfor.423.t:0 "Japan Wants Control of our Dockyards"
 japfor.423.d:0 "The Japanese army and naval official this morning officially demanded control of all dockyards built by their companies in our country. They are reasoning that during these hard wartimes, naval production must be unified under their command."

 japfor.424.t:0 "Japan Returns Dockyards to Us"

 japfor.427.d:0 "In a truly audacious move, we have been denied control of the very dockyards we worked to create. While it would be diplomatically ill-advised to react straight away, we will not forget this betrayal. They will regret this."

 japfor.450.d:0 "For months we have been worried about the extent of Japanese ambitions and their aggressive moves in the South Pacific, and now we have reason to be. They have stated their intent to lead their sphere of influence to immediately end trade with [Root.GetNameDef], calling us an 'outpost of European colonialism and imperialism in Asia'. The strain this could place on our economy is not to be underestimated..."

Our military experts warn that we might not be able to fend off such an invasion, considering the state of the Japanese and government navies and the size of the Japanese military. They suggest that we go to the kaiser and beg him for help: their interest, maintaining the status-quo, aligns with ours and a Japanese takeover would threaten their possessions too. This might be our best shot at maintaining our colonial possession."

They point out however, that a Japanese takeover of their colony would severely upset our own defensive situation, and there is no doubt at all that the Japanese seek to evict us from the region as well!"

They are now moving towards a divide and conquer strategy for all of China. Our China. While this does signal that war with them might come sooner than we think, it has also damaged the standing of the Concordia Association, giving us more room to manoeuvre."

 japfor.462.t:0 "Japan Pursues the Burn to Ash Strategy"
 japfor.462.d:0 "Word of abuses by Japanese troops against Chinese civilians have made their way to our ears for some time now. The Japanese Consulate in Mukden always assured us that these were exaggerated, and that where such crimes did occur they were the fault of indisciplined troops; an exception rather than the norm. However, Japan has now done the unthinkable. It has not only signalled open support for these horrific atrocities, but it has codified them as part of an official strategy. Such unparalleled barbarism cannot be tolerated, and we cannot afford to be painted guilty by association. Fortunately the pro-Japanese Concordia Association will have a hard time explaining this one away, will lose influence in our government."

Soon, Sakura trees may line the Zhaode Dajie in Shenyang and Tiannanmen in Beijing. Our exact position in this new order is unclear, but we will not suffer the same fate as Korea; the Japanese must go, Concordia Association and all."

 japfor.464.d:0 "In their wisdom, the Japanese government has decided to reward our loyalty, returning back to us land that is rightfully ours. While we are of course pleased at such a gesture, we must be careful; the Concordia Association has gained much support as a result, which will make it more difficult for us to oppose Japan in the future, should we wish to."

Now they are here in full force, this invasion will test our mettle and bravery, and we shall not falter.The Japanese are despicable barbarians. Already reports have reached us of unspeakable crimes and one can only imagine the fate of their countrymen at the hands of the loathsome pirates. The Western Powers, preoccupied with the events in Europe and America have abandoned us to our fate. \n\nAnd while we are in danger, has China not resisted and fought back against invaders for centuries? Our civilisation dates back 4,000 years - a testament to our glorious will and determination. We will resist their invasion with the greatest of tenacity and drive the Japanese back to their islands.

With each day, the Chinese armies disintegrate and break and victory is only a matter of when.\nThe Chinese however are offering considerable resistance to our liberation. They do not understand our true intentions of peace and our desire for a united Asian front against German imperialism. There are even rumours that should our advance push significantly far enough into the Chinese interior - the Chinese will even destroy the Yellow river embankments sacrificing the lives of hundreds of thousands of innocent fellow-nationals. Such an outrageous and cruel act will never be permitted by man or Heaven. \nNonetheless one must not doubt the strength and determination of His Imperial Majesty’s Army!

Soldiers and citizens, warlords and republicans, landlords and peasants - put away your squabbling for now is the time for unity! Greedy barbarians will always envy our beautiful country but they shall not have it.

Our commanders in the field have already begun to bicker and quarrel, undertaking their own divergent initiatives, which the government in Tokyo and sometimes even Imperial Headquarters cannot constrain. On top of this the long-standing Army-Navy rivalry has already spilled over into the Chinese War, as the navy refuses to ship equipment, or even throws it overboard at ports, leaving it for the army to fish out of the water.\n\n\Now that we are set to push further into China, our supply lines winding along muddy footpaths and through treacherous mountain passes, this problem can only worsen.

This is a political party that seeks to promote pro-Japanese views in [FNG.GetNameDef] and keep [FNG.GetLeader] subservient. In the long-run, its goals are to extend Japanese economic control over Manchuria further in partnership with Mantetsu, and slowly bring China proper into our orbit too.\n\nStanding apart from the politics of Manchuria's civilian authorities is our own military, the notoriously ambitious Kwantung Army. For decades now the army has sought to conquer and annex Manchuria, and their preferred methods and patience for working with the likes of [FNG.GetLeader] are infamously brutal and low respectively.\n\n Recently the government's policy aims have changed, the war situation we find ourselves facing makes the political independence of [FNG.GetNameDef] less and less suitable as certain allies become more valuable.\n\nWe face a choice: do we trust in the Concordia Association and the soft power they have steadily built up, or will we let the army off its leash and bring Zhang down by any means necessary?"
