### Leaders ###
 POLITICS_ARTHUR_HORNER_DESC:0 "Born in the mining town of Merthyr Tydfil in Southern Wales, the young Arthur Horner was very much a working-class lad. As the eldest surviving son of seventeen children, of whom only six lived past infancy, his career began in the mines of Wales, and the idealistic young man came into contact with the mining unions of Southern Wales, becoming a member.\nHe would continue his low-level political activism in Welsh mining unions until the British Revolution of 1925, when the Monarchy was forced out and the Union of Britain was declared by the Trade Union Congress.\n\nDuring the Revolution, Horner was a key organiser of Miner's strikes in Wales and played a large role in guaranteeing the support of Miner's unions of Wales. After the death of the revolutionary leader John Maclean, Horner became involved in the emerging factionalism of the TUC, becoming an important leader of the status quo Federationist faction, favouring the Unions and the status quo established after the 1925 revolution.\n\nHorner's big moment came when Philip Snowden retired from the position of General Secretary of the TUC, and Horner captured and canvassed enough votes to become the new General Secretary of what is the vanguard of Syndicalism in Europe. Socialist Britain stands united under its General Secretary, for better and worse times to come!"
 POLITICS_PHILIP_SNOWDEN_DESC:0 "The mild-mannered Viscount almost shouldn't have been the Chairman of the British Trade Union Congress, yet somehow he is, and he is well liked by the factions of what is a viciously factional body. Snowden's victory is largely credited to his decision to avoid the fractional politics of the Trade Union Congress and how he showed himself to be an unaligned and neutral candidate, free of partiality. Since his assuming of the title of Chairman, Snowden has seen old faces go and new faces come in the TUC, but he has always remained a symbol of British post-revolutionary unity, always calming factional tensions wherever they come, and seeking to maintain a balance between all four factions- which is perhaps why he unopposed Mosley's bid for Exchequer. The former Liberal-turned-Syndicalist is perhaps the most normal figure in these strange times, always staying above and refusing to occupy his time with petty insults. As the 1936 Congress of Trade Unions approaches, Snowden has given many hints to his possible retirement- an uncomfortable reality to say the least."
 POLITICS_TRADE_UNION_CONGRESS_DESC:0 "Until the next year, the Trade Union Congress will have to work without a Chairman."
 POLITICS_OSWALD_MOSLEY_DESC:0 "Oswald Mosley, left with a permanent limp from a flying accident during the Weltkrieg, entered into British politics a conservative. By the outbreak of the British Revolution, however, Mosley famously crossed the floor of parliament to stand with the revolutionaries of the Independent Labour Party.\n\nMosley, despite his physical impairment, quickly became perhaps the most passionate orator on the left. His firebrand speeches, particularly his famous address before the conservative workers of Birmingham, propelled Mosley to the forefront of the Trade Union movement, and eventually leadership of the governing TUC.\n\nMosley, founder of the authoritarian Maximist faction of the TUC, is a vocal exponent of increased centralisation, and aggressive foreign policy."
 POLITICS_NICLAS_GLAIS_DESC:0 "Niclas Y Glais and the poetry, both in English and Welsh, he penned regarding the struggles of the working class, inspired many typically conservative rural labourers to embrace the British Revolution; his Welsh translation of the British anthem "The Red Flag" is sung by Welsh socialists of all stripes.\n\nDespite fierce opposition, Glais advocates both on the floor of the Trade Union Congress, and through his poetry, the devolution of power from the TUC to workers' assemblies in Wales and Scotland. The people of these regions, he argues, are both culturally different from that of England and currently politically underrepresented. With Glais as chairman of the Trade Union Congress, power is likely to be increasingly decentralised."
 POLITICS_ANNIE_KENNEY_DESC:0 "Sylvia Pankhurst, the daughter of Dr. Richard Pankhurst and Emmeline Pankhurst, was born in Old Trafford, Manchester on 5th May, 1882. Her father was a committed socialist and a strong advocate of women's suffrage. In 1906, Sylvia Pankhurst started to work full-time for the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) with her sister Christabel and their mother. She applied her artistic talents on behalf of the WSPU, devising its logo and various leaflets, banners, and posters as well as the decoration of its meeting halls. In 1907 she toured industrial towns in England and Scotland, painting portraits of working-class women in their working environments. During the First World War Sylvia Pankhurst was horrified to see her mother Emmeline and her sister Christabel become enthusiastic supporters of the war drive and campaign in favour of military conscription. She was opposed to the war, and was publicly attacked in the newly renamed WSPU newspaper Britannia. Sylvia's antiwar activities lead her to become the leader of the British Section of the Third International. By 1922 the British Section had submitted to the Syndicalist ideology, thereby moving from an antiwar position to a pro General Strike position."
 POLITICS_TOM_MANN_DESC:0 "Tom Mann, the famous first General Secretary of the Trade Union Congress, has been appointed as chairman of the TUC following electoral gridlock. Mann, though a Leninist, has shown great historical commitment to the Trade Union movement and a dedicated spirit of civil service. Mann, in his old age, however, has indicated that he does not intend to stand for re-election."
 POLITICS_CLEM_ATTLEE_DESC:0 "Clem Attlee, shocked and disgusted by the poverty he witnessed while working at youth charity, became a prominent figure within the Independent Labour Party, and eventually the Trade Union movement. His activism, however, was cut short by the Weltkrieg.\nAttlee served on multiple fronts during war, and was eventually promoted to the rank of major. While Attlee's army service did instil in him a strong work ethic, it only entrenched his opposition to rigid hierarchy.\n\nAttlee, in British politics, is an ally, but not formal member of, the Autonomists."
 POLITICS_BARBARA_CASTLE_DESC:0 "Barbara Castle, as a girl of only fifteen, led the children of her secondary girls' school in a rising in support of the British Revolution. The quirky red-haired girl quickly became a cultural icon throughout the newly established Union of Britain.\nAs she grew into a young woman, Castle again came into the public eye as the first female leader of the Oxford Students' Union, and never again left it. She became an increasingly vocal Congregationist, and eventually challenged the leadership of the admittedly magnanimous Sylvia Pankhurst.\n\nAs chairwoman of the TUC, Castle has vowed to fight the injustices that still plague the Union of Britain, especially inequities between men and women."
 POLITICS_ERIC_BLAIR_DESC:0 "Eric Blair, the famous writer who helped propel his long-time ally Oswald Mosley to political prominence, came gradually to oppose Mosley. At every opportunity, Mosley seemed to tread upon the principles of the Union of Britain and the revolution which created it.\n\nBlair, with political triumph over his old friend, has vowed to restore to the people of Britain the freedoms Mosley so egregiously stripped from them."
 POLITICS_WILLIAM_GALLACHER_DESC:0 "William Gallacher founded the Labour Withholding Committee in opposition to the Weltkrieg era Munitions Act. Jailed in his native Glasgow for undermining the war effort, Gallacher became increasingly radicalised. Upon release from prison, Gallacher joined the Glasgow Trades Council, part of the greater British Trade Union Movement, and organised it into an effective militia force during the revolution.\n\nNow in charge of the Union, he will no doubt pursue the status quo course."
 POLITICS_INTERIM_DESC:0 "With Philip Snowden's shock resignation, an Interim Committee made up of nonpartisan TUC members has been formed to lead a caretaker government until all the TUC ballots are cast."
 POLITICS_COMMUNAL_DESC:0 "With Y Glais finally being able to fulfil his dream of transforming the Union, the last reform is to abolish the position of Chairman and instead replace it with a communal presidency headed by a committee elected by the regional TUCs."

Yet, while we have cast off many reactionary traditions our love of the navy has remained, we must always be at the forefront of naval research and development. We must always Rule the Waves."

Yet, despite destroying the chains that tied Ireland to capitalism, we have faced steep resistance from both the popular Irish Republican Army, primarily located in the Munster countryside, and the royalist Ulster Volunteer Force active throughout the North-east."

### Focuses ###
 ENG_status_quo:0 "Embrace the Status Quo"
 ENG_status_quo_desc:0 "The syndicalist order has withstood an onslaught of political challenges, but has held firm. Britain shall keep its course, and continue to boldly and unapologetically champion the cause of the worker and the revolution above all else."
 ENG_united_britain:0 "United Britain"
 ENG_united_britain_desc:0 "Britain faces great adversity both within and without. While conflict with reactionary nations may prove unavoidable, surely our nation and its people should stand united. Enemies of the revolution must be confronted and eliminated by any means necessary."
 ENG_decentralized_command:0 "Decentralised Command"
 ENG_decentralized_command_desc:0 "While our armies are decentralised, they still rely on inefficient chains of command to make tactical decisions. Non-commissioned officers and even the humblest of militiamen must be instilled with the spirit of leadership and given the agency to direct their units as they see fit. No man should die waiting for an order to be issued."
 ENG_new_generals:0 "Promote Young Talent"
 ENG_new_generals_desc:0 "There exists an abundance of young, talented officers among our ranks, often overlooked due to superiors more interested in improving the conditions of their fellow pupils than the condition of their army. A new round of promotions, aimed at young officers with admirable performance in the military academies, will be conducted to give our military the shake-up it needs."

 ENG_the_common_land:0 "The Common Land"
 ENG_the_common_land_desc:0 "While Britain was the birthplace of the industrial revolution, much of our nation remains rural and reliant on agriculture. To facilitate increased crop yields, all lands seized from noble estates during the revolution should be parcelled to rural syndicates. Britain's land shall now belong to her people alone!"

 ENG_cayley_plan:0 "The Hidden Fleet Plan"
 ENG_cayley_plan_desc:0 "During the Weltkrieg, the Germans used U-Boats to great effect. Their ultimate victory in the war has convinced influential groups of officers that to avoid our previous fate, Britain must rapidly expand its submarine fleet and restructure its doctrine with Germany as its model"
 ENG_anstice_plan:0 "The Aviation Fleet Plan"
 ENG_anstice_plan_desc:0 "While many scoff at the notion that aircraft could ever serve as the backbone of a navy, believers of precisely such a thing assert the necessity of controlling the skies over the sea. To do so, they propose that the role and number of aircraft carriers be greatly expanded"
 ENG_dickens_plan:0 "The Grand Fleet Plan"
 ENG_dickens_plan_desc:0 "The Royal Navy was centred around the battleship and naval firepower. While Britain lost the Weltkrieg, its Navy held strong throughout the conflict. Since the revolution, naval strategy has advanced rapidly, and to many Republican naval officers, the Union of Britain must make a concerted effort to catch up to its rivals, rather than take a radical new approach to naval warfare."
 ENG_merchant_marine:0 "Merchant Marine"
 ENG_merchant_marine_desc:0 "The British Merchant Service was on the bleeding edge of civilian shipping administration. During the Weltkrieg, tactics developed by the Service to counter U-Boat raids kept Britain from terrible starvation. If our republic is to have any chance of surviving future conflicts, we must develop a robust Merchant Marine to both regulate shipping and conscript civilian ships for military service when needed."
 ENG_expand_dockyards:0 "Expand Dockyards"
 ENG_expand_dockyards_desc:0 "With a Merchant Marine service established and all union operated ships firmly integrated, our nation's ports are becoming increasingly congested. With the problem projected to only worsen, we must immediately expand the most clogged ports."
 ENG_new_admirals:0 "Promote Fresh Leadership"
 ENG_new_admirals_desc:0 "For too long the Republican Navy has been too much of an old boy's club and this could seriously damage our naval effectiveness. To combat this we should ensure that some fresh new faces can take the reigns of leadership."
 ENG_submarines:0 "Submarine Effort"
 ENG_submarines_desc:0 "Per our efforts to shift the Republican Navy's focus, our presently quite small submarine fleet is due for expansion. Our current submarine designs, however, are inadequate. We must develop and deploy more advanced models"
 ENG_destroyers:0 "Destroyer Effort"
 ENG_destroyers_desc:0 "Our new fleet cannot operate entirely below the waves. To support out U-Boats, we need ships that are both versatile and agile, capable of dealing with those threats are U-Boats are unable to."
 ENG_carrier_efforts:0 "Carrier Effort"
 ENG_carrier_efforts_desc:0 "Aircraft Carriers have taken on a much greater role in naval combat, and Britain must change with the times. Our carrier fleet will be the centrepiece of the renewed British Navy."
 ENG_naval_aviation:0 "Naval Aviation"
 ENG_naval_aviation_desc:0 "Traditional aircraft designs are unable to fulfil the unique requirements of naval aviation. We must develop new aircraft designed be operated from carriers and other situations where runway space is at a premium."
 ENG_battlecruisers:0 "Battleship Effort"
 ENG_battlecruisers_desc:0 "While lacking the armour of a Dreadnought, Battleships are agile and pack a versatile suite of heavy guns. An evolution of the Battlecruisers of WW1 who served effectively during the Weltkrieg, an expansion of our Battleship fleets is essential to the reconstruction of the British Navy."
 ENG_battleships:0 "Dreadnought Effort"
 ENG_battleships_desc:0 "Dreadnoughts are the kings of the sea, and were key to the global dominance of the British Royal Navy at the prior to the Weltkrieg. If we are to ever regain our naval strength, we must have new battleships."
 ENG_republican_marines:0 "The Republican Marines"
 ENG_republican_marines_desc:0 "While naval power and the projection thereof are critical to military success, ships alone are unable to invade islands or assault coasts. Few Marine officers sided with the revolution in 1925, and as a result, the Republic's ability to conduct amphibious operations was stunted. If we are to having any hope of confronting our enemies across the seas, we must have a Marine department."
 ENG_revolutionary_admiralty:0 "Review the Republican Navy"
 ENG_revolutionary_admiralty_desc:0 "The Office of the Admiralty and Marine Affairs was the body responsible for the administration of the Royal Navy and served as a forum for communication between officers. The Republican Navy currently lacks any comparable office, with Naval affairs often tied-up in politics. Thus, we must establish an independent and thoroughly socialist Admiralty."
 ENG_brittania_rules_the_waves:0 "Britannia Rules the Waves"
 ENG_brittania_rules_the_waves_desc:0 "At last, the British Navy is beginning to look like its former self. If not already, soon enough, Britain will again rule the waves! Britons never will be slaves!"

 ENG_republican_air_force:0 "The Republican Air Force"
 ENG_republican_air_force_desc:0 "Air power is critical for success on the modern battlefield. Currently, our air service is subordinate to our army, and while that assures democratisation, an independent Air Force would certainly be more effective. Thus, we must establish an Air Force both independent and socialist in character."
 ENG_new_pilot_training:0 "New Pilot Training"
 ENG_new_pilot_training_desc:0 "Pilot training in many nations, including our own, has been largely non-standard, and reliant on enthusiasts turned instructors. By consulting with prominent pilots, we can develop an effective training regimen."
 ENG_flying_women:0 "Women's Flying Corps"
 ENG_flying_women_desc:0 "Capable pilots are always in short supply, and the women of our nation, whose support was so crucial to the success of the revolution, yearn for the freedom of the skies. While it will certainly prove controversial, we have drafted a plan to create allow women to serve in the RAF in support roles to free up more men for combat."
 ENG_aviation_unions:0 "Aviation Unions"
 ENG_aviation_unions_desc:0 "Many syndicates around Britain operate small aerodromes for a variety of purposes. The larger of these facilities should be given state funding for expansion."
 ENG_aviation_fuel_administration:0 "Aviation Fuel Administration"
 ENG_aviation_fuel_administration_desc:0 "Without fuel, it does not matter how skilled our pilots are. It is likely that when war comes our fuel imports will be cut-off so we must work towards domestics sources of fuel; for the safety of the revolution we mustn't be depended on capitalist suppliers of oil. They can't be trusted."
 ENG_air_observer_corps:0 "Air Observer Corps"
 ENG_air_observer_corps_desc:0 "While London was terrorised throughout the Weltkrieg by German airships, relatively little damage was done by these raids. Since then however, the range and payload of aircraft has increased greatly. To counter the threat, we should create a volunteer organisation which looks vigilantly for enemy planes to forewarn our interceptor and anti-aircraft teams."
 ENG_expand_air_unions:0 "Expand Air Unions"
 ENG_expand_air_unions_desc:0 "Our programme of aerodrome enlargement was of great benefit to the expansion of the Republican Air Force, but proved to be a substantial administrative burden. With the air force now well-established, the Air Union programme can be expanded."

 ENG_international:0 "Britain Within the International"
 ENG_international_desc:0 "Britain's political factions advocate quite different foreign policy approaches. With the turbulent 1936 special session of the TUC at an end, Britain's place in the world, and especially its relationship with its socialist comrades of the Third Internationale, must be reassessed."
 ENG_anglo_norwegian_cooperation:0 "Norwegian Comrades"
 ENG_anglo_norwegian_cooperation_desc:0 "A more equitable Norway has arisen, and we will stand arm in arm with our socialist brethren there. The Norwegian and British people have much to offer each other, and as a gesture of our goodwill, we shall offer Norway generous economic assistance in exchange simply for future cooperation."
 ENG_anglo_irish_friendship:0 "Irish Comrades"
 ENG_anglo_irish_friendship_desc:0 "With the light of socialism at last shining upon the Emerald Isle, the time for reconciliation between our historically closely linked peoples has come. Not only should we send diplomats and politicians to Dublin, but also representatives of the most successful British syndicates to help Ireland along the path of progress."
 ENG_class_warfare:0 "Class Warfare"
 ENG_class_warfare_desc:0 "War is upon us, and to preserve our great nation and secure our liberty, all working men must now unite for victory. We should promote the spirit of unity, self-sacrifice, and most of all, renewed class consciousness, to augment our war effort."
 ENG_never_surrender:0 "We Shall Never Surrender"
 ENG_never_surrender_desc:0 "As with any war effort, there are many detractors who advocate reconciliation with the enemy. To counter this sentiment, we should begin a propaganda campaign to promote the just nature of our war and the necessity of victory."
 ENG_bletchley_park:0 "Bletchley Park"
 ENG_bletchley_park_desc:0 "In the north of Buckinghamshire, a crack team of military intelligence researchers has emerged. Despite minimal funding, the Bletchley Park Electrician's Union, in coordination with our foreign intelligence service, has produced singular results. We should expand Bletchley Park's facilities and provide them with substantial state funding."
 ENG_support_comrades:0 "Support Foreign Comrades"

While it once represented the Syndicalist dream of true proletarian government, it now symbolises Centralist repression to many.

 uob.0.t:0 "The New Britain"
 uob.0.d:0 "After the defeat of France, the United Kingdom's war with Germany would not last long - the exhausted Great Powers soon agreed to a formal peace in the Treaty of Versailles in late 1919, which came to be informally known in Britain as Lloyd-George's \"Peace with Honour\". While Britain's overseas territories remained largely intact, the faith of the people did not.\n\nIn 1925, disaster struck: a minor labour dispute in the coalfields of South Wales quickly escalated, and after six weeks of rioting, looting and pamphleteering, most of the "establishment", including the Royal Family, had fled to Canada. A provisional government of revolutionary groups dissolved what little was left of Parliament, and declared a new "Union of Britain".\n\nEleven years later, the Trade Union Congress still forms the centrepiece of politics of the federated and democratic Union. The British people are secure on their island, having built up a socialist dream, protected by the strong Republican Air Force and Navy, and with each county protected by its own popular militia who act both as a reserve military and the new police.\n\nYet, with the world seemingly ready to erupt into chaos and its continental allies clamouring for war, many are starting to wonder if Britain has a duty to spread the revolution to her former colonial territories. After all, the Monarchists in Canada cannot be allowed to plot against the Union forever..."

He claimed that in face of massive rifts within the TUC and due to his age he intends to resign his post immediately and have an interim committee take his place until the final ballots are cast. He also pulled out the cliche 'time with the family' bit that all politicians do. The congregation stood silent as he climbed down from the podium and made his way out of the hall.

 uob.15.d:0 "With the newest aircraft carrier RNS Rebecca fully operational the Republican Navy was ready to reclaim her rightful position among the mightiest navies of the world. However the target of her first action was heavily disputed. Most officers opted for a full scale naval manoeuvre near Ireland or even further west wards - near the Azores or Iceland. But a naval manoeuvre of such large scale would surely draw attention of the much more powerful and heavily armed Hochseeflotte and even the smaller Canadian Royal navy might be forced to organise countermeasures. Most members of the Congress of Trade Unions opted for a small scale manoeuvre possibly without even leaving British territorial waters. Ultimately the Naval Commissar was inclined in favour for the Irish option."

 uob.231.t:0 "Mending the Wounds"
 uob.231.d:0 "The coup has been averted peacefully, but it should never have happened in the first place.

 uob.361.d:0 "Comrade Eric Blair, once an ally of Grand Protector Mosley, cannot stand it any longer. For too long the evil Mosley had perverted the constitution and made the Union of Britain his plaything. A popular writer and skilled militia commander, Blair alone has the authority to bring down the tyrant. As Blair stared out into the rain today, he knew he had to take action."

While officially no testament has been found, it is an open secret that Blair was no longer an ally of Grand Protector Mosley.\n\nAs the 'improvised' demonstration in his honour slowly and quietly travelled through the streets of London, ever more people joined, many with tears in their eyes. Some wept for the man, some for the last hope against Mosley's dictatorship."

There are no two ways about it; without oil our planes, tanks and ships are nothing but scrap, no matter the skill of their crew.\n\nSince we first realised the issue, monumental effort has been spent attempting to cultivate domestic sources of oil. Some, like the shale oils in Scotland, have seen mild success. Others, like the French oil fields, have been near total failures. Fortunately, many saw this coming, and so resources had already been put towards researching synthetic sources of oil. If we divert enough resources in this direction, it may just be possible..."
 uob.363.a:0 "It will have to be enough..."

 uob.364.t:0 "Support from the Union of Britain"
 uob.364.d:0 "Today an envoy from the Union of Britain arrived.

 uob.1001.d:0 "It took quite some time, but our intelligence services finally managed to find the man who still regularly solves the hardest crossword puzzles in the country with ease. His name is Alan Turing, a math professor before the revolution, currently living in London. He first tried to evade our men, but after some time, calmed down. And in fact, he already had a project in mind when our scientists asked what kind of research we could assist and support him in. It all seems very technical, and, more importantly, hideously expensive, but our experts assure us that this Turing might be on the right path to something extraordinary..."

For the first time, military encryption and decryption are conducted by a machine. This will give the Union an important edge in any military conflict."

Today, as she was about to dock at a Paris airfield, she burst into flames and crashed to the ground. 35 people out of 97 (plus one of the ground crew) died."

They argue that 'all arts need to be brought together to create an actual, total work of art, a Gesamtkunstwerk.' Needless to say, many of the proposers have adapted this view of the arts onto their political life, where they stand for Maximist views. They have also made themselves quite popular with drafts for Unionised Living Space for poorer comrades.\n\nThe artistic world of the Union is divided as sculptors, potters and writers deny having to do anything with those architects, and a clear path must be set. Should we establish one Union for all our artists, or leave things as they are?"

 uob.1026.d:0 "Built as a display hall for the Great Exhibition of 1844, the Crystal Palace was a cast-iron and plate-glass marvel of the old British Empire. During the Weltkrieg, it was transformed into the Royal Navy training station HMS Victory VI. As a result, it became one of the last holdouts of royalists in London, and was destroyed by fire during the Revolution. The gutted skeleton of the building has been left to rot over the last ten years as London worked on its industry and defences. A proposal has been put forward to rebuild the Crystal Palace as an exhibition hall where the men and women of the International will display their industrial and cultural products as equals, not as imperial trophies. However, it would be an expensive undertaking to get it ready in time for next year, and a large part of the Congress advocates simply tearing the ruins down and expanding the surrounding parkland."

 uob.1034.d:0 "In an unusual turn of events, the government has today announced that the Witchcraft Act of 1735 is to be repealed and that all those currently tried under the law are to have their sentences halved. Under normal circumstances this would not raise eyebrows as many old laws were imported in the creation of the new constitution and progressively rescinded though this one has stuck out.\n\nOne week ago, a Scottish medium by the name Helen Duncan was arrested on the grounds of falsely claiming to procure spirit and obtaining money under false pretences before being sentenced to nine months in prison. Duncan will no doubt go down in history as the last person to be tried and arrested under the Witchcraft Act."

 uob.1035.d:0 "The Republican Air Force base at Penrhos was burned down last night in what seemed like a random arson attack. However, this morning the three culprits; Saunders Lewis; Lewis Valentine and DJ Williams turned themselves in at the Pwllheli Police Station. In an eloquent defence, Saunders Lewis referred to the construction of the airbase at such a historic cultural monument 'a crime against Wales' and that this was simply the act of a 'downtrodden people lashing out.' The Maximists of the TUC have called for the alleged ringleader Williams to be executed and his co-conspirators imprisoned. In a more calm tone, the Federationists have called for the three men to be arrested and finally the Autonomists and Congregationists have called for them to be acquitted."
