 SWF_oppress_opposition:0 "Crush the Revolution's Enemies"

 SWF_militia_focus:0 "Worker's Militias"
 SWF_militia_focus_desc:0 "Our first order of business is to look to our army - to ensure that it consists of hard workers, those devoted to the new socialist order.

 SWF_radio_focus:0 "Receptador del Pueblo"

 SWF_military_focus:0 "Defending the Revolution"
 SWF_military_focus_desc:0 "Our new regime sees threats from every corner of Europe and beyond. We must work quickly towards rebuilding and strengthening our revolutionary militias into a full and modern army."

 SWF_mobile_army_focus:0 "A Mobile Army"
 SWF_mobile_army_desc:0 "The ways of footsoldiers and horses will soon be a thing of the past, if they are not already. The cost of equipping our forces with vehicles will be high, but it is necessary."

 SWF_join_french_war:0 "Join the French War Effort"
 SWF_join_french_war_desc:0 "The Commune of France is engaged in a war which will determine the balance of the revolution here and across the world. We must offer our strength, no matter the cost."
